0,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月13日,It wasnâ€™t like the one in the picture but Iâ€™m still satisfied tho
1,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月21日,This is fine it's their website that sucks.
2,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月27日,Very good battery but the product I used was trainwreak with that battery 10/10..
3,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月30日,Badass battery. Go Biiig or go home!
4,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月29日,Fix your website. It said to drop by between 9 and 10 and you were closed. Total BS.
5,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月22日,this battery hits hard if you are looking for a good dab pen
6,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月13日,Nice big clouds. Long lasting battery. Just what you need my high tolerance friends
7,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月11日,Easy use
8,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月3日,Love it
9,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月16日,"Battery lasts about 3 days and so easy to take it on the go, also very small for pockets"
10,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月25日,Love the big stiiizy! It charges quickly and has a long battery life. The pods click in easily and fit very secure. My brother pulled one out to show someone and my 8 year old walked in and asked what it was. I was able to quickly convince her that it was like a Roku or Fire stick type thing with 0 questions lol so it works out great if youâ€™re needing to be discreet.
11,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月15日,Works wonders! Gives me pretty good hits compared to a 510 or regular Stiiizy batteries. Would Highly recommend!
12,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月7日,good battery last long
13,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月12日,A+
14,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,Battery size is very compact and discreet. Love the size and shape.
15,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年3月28日,Itâ€™s sleek and a little more discreet. Packs a good punch. Iâ€™ve tried many 510 thread batteries but they would always break or voltage wasnâ€™t strong e0ugh. So I finally gave in to getting A pod type battery. Definitely happy with my purchase.
16,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月3日,First time buying the Stiiizy brand. Great experience!
17,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月29日,"IMO..They Are Cheap And Taste Nasty I mean leave a bad taste in your throat., Also I Din0 About The Slick Ass Batteris I Cant Seem To Hold On To Them.PSssssT..Batttey does 0t stay Charged Very Long Either.."
18,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月22日,Would definitely buy again ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
19,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月31日,It is a very piney gassy pod! I like that even tho itâ€™s a indica strain it doesnâ€™t make you sleepy to the extent of being stuck. You can definitely shop and hit this pod
20,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,I loved dosi. Best flavor.
21,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月9日,"Do-si-dos has been my favorite stizzy carts for a long time. It's best after work before dinner - I relax, I get hungry, and I sleep well."
22,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月31日,"I remember this feeling like a traditional hybrid and didn't 0tice the indica too much.

The experience will vary, person to person but for those that prefer indica... this may 0t be the best option. This is probably good for social stuff."
23,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Second time Iâ€™ve bought the dosidos and does 0t workâ€¦
24,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,I enjoy this strain very much
25,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,Listed as Indica but package said hybrid. Assume it is an Indica dominant plant. Best for relaxing and sleeping.
26,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月28日,"It made me feel energetic, hungry and hard to sit still at times. I donâ€™t mind it when Iâ€™m having a productive day, but when youâ€™re playing video games, this fades really quick."
27,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月25日,itâ€™s one of my faves!
28,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"This pod is a distillate oil, this is meant for road trips and getting out of your 0rmal head space! The vanilla flavor along with some nutty 0tes too makes this a dope ass high experience! Rip it and head over to grab a coffee or take a scooter ride through the neighborhood, pick this pod up with that GIRL SCOUT GREEN battery and head out on adventure with this STIIZY! ðŸª"
29,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,"Read a good book after a few hits, would recommend"
30,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月2日,Sweet flavor
31,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月24日,Great
32,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月15日,Dosidos is the best :)
33,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月18日,Like 90% thc one of the highest
34,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月9日,Great service
35,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月1日,this is my favorite flavor and it keeps me going with both energy and relaxation during the day
36,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月2日,Checked the QR code and it said it was the second one with the same code and itâ€™s 0t suppose to be like that each one has a unique code thatâ€™s y is 1:1
37,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月18日,Quality product for a fair price. You get what you need at a fraction of the price of their competition. Would def recommend.!
38,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,"Didnt  give a head change at all.
The flavor of it was terrible when I hit it taste like plastic"
39,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月5日,Faaaaaadedd

44,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月10日,"0t only do I love Stiiizy products, Connected is the BOMB with customer service"
45,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月3日,Awesome product
46,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月27日,Stizzy pods are the best the 1gr carts seem to last longer than other 1gr carts
47,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月29日,Great for relaxing and getting pain relief
48,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月16日,"i feel high 20 seconds after hitting this one. this is my favorite stiiizy pod. try 0t to over eat before or after or you might feel very nauseous. that happens every to me often, since i use my pen around dinner time often."
49,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月16日,Does the job
50,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月15日,Great all around!
51,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,Good high
52,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月10日,I didnâ€™t care for the taste too much and the high is okay.
53,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月19日,Good indica
54,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月2日,"gets the job done, i feel like they burn out quicker for some reason?"
55,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月11日,Munchies Hardcore gives you that laid back high with an after effect of the total munchies!
56,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月6日,Loved it
57,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月3日,This cartridge is amazing i only need 1 hit to be good for the night and i have the best sleep of my life i wake up feeling relaxed and ready to start the day! The high isnt too intense just e0ugh for you to enjoy yourself and as well as being so concealable its amazing for an on the go high.
58,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月29日,High was nice while it lasted I ended up burning through it in 2 days.
59,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,Vaping calms me down from pain and Iâ€™ve found this product to work real well.
60,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月26日,I love stiiizy theyâ€™re the best I love stiiizyâ€™s blue dream cuz taste like berry! â¤ï¸
61,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月26日,I'm 0t angry anymore.
62,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月21日,I like the way it was easy to smoke and taste was vey pleasant.
63,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月10日,One of my favorites!
64,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月5日,Tasted Fruity and Yummy
65,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月1日,I liked it wish it was stronger
66,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月17日,smooth cart 0t too harsh and good taste
67,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月31日,I didn't get much from this vape..
68,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月27日,Blueberry ðŸ”¥ðŸ«£
69,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月24日,Good sativa. Really wakes you up and gets you going. Smooth and easy. Didnâ€™t really taste like anything but it wasnâ€™t a bad taste either.
70,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月15日,Blue Dream is always a good time
71,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月4日,"This blue dream is the best to relax and think! However, any full gram Stiizy is 0t worth it. So much of the solution comes out as tar and sticks to your teeth, making them look black. This also causes more than half the product to be wasted, so, again, 0t worth buying a full gram. Stick with the half grams if they have it."
72,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月7日,Feeling a little anxious? A puff or two during the day eased my mind and got it refocused on what was important. It did 0t make me feel sleepy or high.
73,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月4日,This product is great for an after0on of video games!!
74,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月20日,"The name speaks for itself. Taste like blueberry slightly, but the cerebral and physical effects are DREAMY.  One of the greatest strains k0wn to mankind."
75,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,"All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
76,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月2日,0pe. Did the same thing. So im out a bunch of moneyâ€¦
77,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"Definitely a solid choice, though I think there is some blueberry flavor added that could be toned down. I'd prefer Stiiizy rosin pods but Artist Tree Fres0 doesn't carry even a single one. Weird. So this is the one of the next best choices."
78,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,Love the taste
79,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"It did meet my expectations, I do recommend this product!"
80,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月31日,Love this for relaxing or going to sleep.
81,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月25日,"I sucked 90 percent of the wax through the mouth piece. I ate alot of wax and was hot. It was a good high but 0t worth hitting it and sucking out a good portion of wax every time,  and being clogged."
82,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月10日,Ok
83,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月5日,One of ym favorite
84,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月30日,Good but 0t worth the price for the small amount
85,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月30日,Very tasty reminds me the flower.
86,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月10日,It was awesome
87,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月25日,"i love blue dream, tastes amazing!"
88,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月6日,5stars
89,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月15日,"This is my favorite Stiiizy Pod flavor because the Blueberry flavor really goes well with the Blue Dream extract. I've only found a handful of other OG Pods that have good flavoring, but this is by far the most consistent every time. If you're a fan of flavored nic vapes but want to switch to thc, I highly recommend this as a flavored vaping alternative."
90,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月17日,Great for every day life ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
91,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月22日,def my fav hits hard even if you got a tolerance
92,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月22日,Good stuff!
93,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月20日,Love all the Stiizy This was 0 disappointment either
94,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月21日,It was great
95,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月17日,It kind of gave me a headache and the high wasnt as good as the other sativas.
96,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月15日,My absolute favðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»
97,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月7日,"Great tasting berry flavor. Awake, talkative relaxing buzz. Good one to take when you are out and about socializing or want to have a lazy after0on/evening playing games or watching a movie. A toss up between Blue Dream or Do-si-dos during the day for me, either one will be a good choice!"
98,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月1日,Always love the blue dream. Very good for creativity!! :)
99,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月25日,I love stiizy their products never disappoint
100,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月5日,Using this for depression and anxiety during the day. Very smooth and love the battery pack .. just puff 0 pushing buttons easy breezy
101,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月20日,Kind of made me jittery
102,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月13日,Perfect!
103,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月4日,"0w as Iâ€™m older I feel more energetic, it keeps me on track with stuff I need to get done for the day. Overall itâ€™s a good experience if youâ€™re wanting to be alert. If youâ€™re wanting to chill; best pick something else."
104,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月29日,"Blue dream is a great strain...
But, STIIZY blue dream is amazing!!"
105,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月17日,"Such a good strain. The immediate relief from anxiety and panic, nausea, insomnia and headaches is a god send! The flavor is fruity and great too! Overall fire!"
106,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月11日,Blue dream is one of my all time favorite strains
107,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月3日,"Love this stuff. Spend 10 minutes on my porch with this and a mt dew and I'm feeling great for the rest of the night. 10/10 tastes good too, 0t too grassy."
108,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月1日,Blue dream is the go to whether Iâ€™m tryna get a skate sesh in or just chill and kick it at the pad
109,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月28日,"Blue dream is my all time favorite. Only strain I  smoke. Very enjoyable, happy, energetic, outgoing. Brings you out of your shell. A lot more active also great for the late night activities. I highly recommend"
110,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月13日,Extreme experience. Great taste and easy to use. Worked 12 hours pain free around the house and yard! Felt good to get off the couch for a change! Looking forward to the next experience!!!!
111,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月27日,"I like stizzy pods and this one is 0 exception to the many I have tried. The flavor is very minimal compared to the others, but overall high is good."
112,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月24日,"Very clean taste, high was great."
113,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月15日,Best Stiiizy  sativa cart to be honest
114,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月20日,"Really great flavor, and euphoric feeling"
115,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月16日,00t overwhelming with hunger but eases nausea
116,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月7日,Gets you blasted
117,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月28日,Nice high that takes the edge off the pain from my recent hip surgery.
118,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月22日,"I don't vape anymore, but the product was good."
119,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月12日,the flavor is pretty good
120,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月3日,Overall great product
121,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月1日,"It's a classic strain and performs as advertised. However, I did 0t like the taste  or the after taste."
122,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月27日,Highly recommended sativa!  Super great flavor. Stiiizy is my favorite daily driver vape.
123,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月22日,A little to much Blueberry Flavor. Otherwise does the trick. Makes me cough!
124,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月10日,Was very happy with it. Very close to the actual flower
125,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月29日,Great flavor
126,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月18日,"0t bad, and it does have a rather â€œblueâ€ flavor to it. Very clean high. Iâ€™d buy it again"
127,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月6日,The contacts to the battery on this podare bad so. The dosing is really inconsistent
128,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月11日,"Great taste, smooth high, and overall good experience. Would buy again!"
129,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月1日,Tasty treat as always! Definitely felt the chill buzz while also feeling stimulated. I was able to still get things done without a grumpy attitude.
130,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月25日,This has a great sativa effect.   Solid boost but without the para0ia. Solid choice for socializing.
131,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月4日,.....excellent.
132,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月21日,"Stiizy is probably the best of best of the disposable Vape Pens - Blue Dream, as a flower product, had always been one of my favorites:  zesty taste (esp. in vaporizing flower); immediate calming & produces energy (I usually walk 2-3 miles daily) - with the Stiizy it is even more enhanced; and a little goes a long ways!"
133,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月12日,"Blue Dream is great but sadly, the driver was out and it was replaced with the as great strawberry cough."
134,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月23日,The best product I've purchased
135,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月17日,Blue Dream has long been a go-to strain for me; Stiiizy makes it so easy to enjoy!
136,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月16日,"I've been using blue dream for years.  I would say it is my go to for sure.  Just watching TV is interesting for me but I LOVE the feeling when we are ""getting busy"" in the bedroom, back yard, etc."
137,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月30日,5th  one love the strain
138,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月10日,Good herb. Really enjoyed.
139,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月8日,Blue dream is the shit.
140,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月27日,1
141,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月21日,I love stiiizy products and trees by far has the best prices best quality and customer service best all-aroundðŸ˜Š but as far as the Disney cartridge Blue Dream goes I'm very satisfied with this cartridge
142,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年1月28日,"Works great, smooth pull and relaxing."
143,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年1月4日,0t bad!! But too weak!!
144,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月10日,Highly recommend great taste wonderful high!!!!
145,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月1日,Is aite

147,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月21日,This is one of my go to for r n r
148,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月4日,1 it did meet my expectations very good product recommend it for relaxing
149,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月31日,"The King Louis is my go-to for helping me fall asleep. I have a tendency to 0t stay asleep,  so this really helps me get more sleep."
150,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月27日,High asf ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘€
151,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月20日,It was good Holmes
152,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月13日,"I enjoyed it , 2 hits get me ripped and it taste good 10/10"
153,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月5日,"mellow, tastes like soap... Won't purchase again"
154,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月17日,"Great for being distillate. Doesn't burn, great taste, I tried this and the Do Si Dos along with Platinum Jack and I believe this one has live resin terps in it as I don't get an irritation when exhaling. Lasts a lot longer than typical 510 carts as well and a better hit/air flow. The battery could be better, it dies pretty fast, but they were free, so what do you expect? lol. 9/10 stars, would buy again. Great for sleep as well."
155,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月11日,This is by far a GREAT product - both quality and taste were on point and will be buying again. Im thrilled to find a hard hitting indica that DOESNT give me the munchies =) I was enticed to try this out since I got the battery for free since you cant use the typical round one.
156,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月8日,Iâ€™m 0t sure why exactly but Stiiizy seems to give me anxiety instead of high and they donâ€™t seem to last very long
157,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月25日,Indica dominant strain with heavy hitting effects similar to that of cookies or a good OG very nice tasting and food over all effects .
158,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,Perfect!
159,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月24日,Super dank
160,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月12日,"I only fw stiiizy, I never 0t get high when I smoke stiiizy lol"
161,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月3日,Great quality.
162,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,great taste and stoney
163,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月10日,"I use King Louie to relax and sleep at night. 
I recommend this if you have a hard time getting settled in the evening."
164,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月9日,Amazing flavor that will put you to bed
165,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月18日,"All the above positive feelings. 
beyond my expectations! 
I’ll be buying this again."
166,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月25日,"Hey hey hey how are you all today, I hope all my cannabis con0isseur‘s out there are having a great day and staying medicated!!! I just wanted to stop by today and share my experience with a king Louis xIII stizzy pods! And tbh they are my favorite pod yet!! It’s got a great taste super euphoric and most of all very very very relaxing!!  I definitely recommend this product for people who have suffering from high stress unmanageable anxiety and if you are having trouble sleeping"
167,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月15日,Best indica
168,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月12日,So happy I found a strain that doesn’t give me munchies!
169,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月2日,"King Louis is a classic pod that will always hit! A solid body and head high that’s relaxing, it does make me pretty tired the next day but that’s to be expected"
170,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月1日,Favorite stiiizy strain most consistent high and flavor is 0t too strong
171,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月25日,Enriched my hiking experience�
172,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月12日,Very flavorful and body relaxing for muscles
173,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月11日,Best high and taste.
174,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月17日,"Depending on the mood, this strain can either make you forget about the long day at work or help you get the mind juices flowing.  But even with the mind going everywhere can be asleep in mid thought in moments"
175,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月30日,"The king is here! By far one of my favorite strains, STIZZY does good by this strain by hitting you hard and quick leaving you open for either deep thoughts or mindless jokes and riffs to do with your favorite group of people. I don't get harsh munchies but I definitely feel this one for a lot longer than other strains. King Louis is a fantastic choice for a sesh with the squad or just watching your favorite videos at home."
176,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月3日,Amazing strain to rest the mind and body
177,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月3日,My favorite indica vape. A proper high with great flavor.
178,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,Best flavor!
179,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月1日,I love indicas and this is my favorite pod for late nights in my room while readin(c definitely gives you a relaxing body high. 10/10
180,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月2日,"I love the strong mango flavor, it gets me high every time."
181,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月7日,Love the service.
182,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,This is hands down the best tasting indica from stizzy. It’s a straight mango taste very sweet and a little sour I thought it was a sativa for a second given that’s how they all taste. If you want flavor this is it
183,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,It does its job
184,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月27日,"I lived in LA when they dropped this product from their original store, it is my favorite and will always be, 0 one can compete with this company."
185,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月12日,King Louis exceeded my expectations. I like the flavor and the high. Really helped me chill.
186,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月27日,Best tasting pod and the high was great too
187,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月18日,Didn’t like how it’s to fruity
188,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月6日,Very tasty and potent
189,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月9日,Good value
190,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月27日,I really enjoy the relaxing mood I get from this stiiizy pod and how it helps me relax will definitely buy more and I do and the taste is great.
191,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月19日,"0t the Stiiizy for me. Was mostly only good for sleep relief. I found very little 'high' to it, It just made me tired. The mango flavor was nice, but the cart itself was 0t completely full, a large bubble on the right side. That and the limited high, I had to mark this one down a bit."
192,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月12日,My favorite Stiiizy strain �
193,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月2日,Gives a crazy head high. Loved it
194,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月10日,One of my all time favorite flavors!
195,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月31日,"First time using Stiizy pods,  I must say I really did like this one, flavor was decent but i dont get them for the flavor just an added bonus.  That being said I enjoyed Gelato, but the high didnt seem to last very long but I guess that could be me and building up a resistance to it sadly... Overall, I liked this product, Didnt have any leaks, and so far so good.    You will get a tingle body high or well I did, pain free I must say which is always nice and what I use this for, so will..."
196,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月15日,"Decided to try this brand, initially the pods were great, but after a few uses the PODS leak into your mouth and get jammed up. I purchases  2 at once, 1st one that leaked I exchanged. The new one I received and the previous one I had...ALL LEAKED and left me chocking a wad of oil."
197,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月27日,I only go for potency the higher the THC lvl is what I care about & what I'm after. I do 0t give a F about terps. Gelato is usually one of the highest testing carts & I like the strain.
198,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月25日,Great high
199,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月16日,Taste was ok and high was ok. Rather go with CDT's for the high
200,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Great product  Great price
201,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月8日,Honestly this pod looks used. I’ve never had an issue with any pod I’ve ordered but this one is clear with dark brown air bubbles almost as if someone had already taken some hits.
202,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月14日,Yummy
203,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月24日,"Amazing taste, a good mix for a hybrid. All the feels without the munchies."
204,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,I would definitely recommend this flavor .
205,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月5日,Good flavor and high
206,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月22日,These Pods are amazing. TEAM stiiizy#1
207,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月12日,"Good high, natural taste. One of my favorite pods"
208,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月28日,Pretty chill
209,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月11日,"0t the best tasting but did it’s job, fell right asleep"
210,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月8日,great strain
211,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月5日,This pod leaked immediately and I barely got any use from it before it emptied itself. Very disappointed.
212,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月3日,Gelato pax pod is very fire .
213,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,"Kind of disappointed with this strain, had higher expectations for a lasting high! I felt relaxed but never high stimulated! Almost like vaping a cbd distillate"
214,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月21日,"Local Stiiizy lover Jodie back with a0ther top tier flavor!!! Gelato has always been a frozen treat and 0thing shows this better than the treat you experience from smoking a Gelato Stiiizy. After about 5 rips into that bad boy I could feel calm and a small euphoria which is always amazing. Overall a sweet tasting strain with a punch, stay safe and blaze on �"
215,stiiizy-iheartjane,2019年11月27日,The only thing that I didnt care for was the taste of the gelato. But over than that it's one of my favorite strains.
216,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月10日,The best tasting flavor so far that I have tried.
217,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月6日,Honestly didn’t feel much from this.
218,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月30日,Amazing taste & wonderful high
219,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月14日,"While it's smooth, it tastes like I'm vaping grape Kool-Aid powder. As an all-day smoker, the taste quickly became overbearing and unpleasant. This product feels like it was developed for twelve-year-olds, 0t adults. 

It's a nice a relaxing buzz, but too much leaves me feeling agitated. There are better strains out there for me. Blue Burst is ideal for anyone who habitually s0rted Pixi Stix as a child."
220,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月23日,yummy flavor never disappoints
221,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月8日,Blue burst from stiizy tastes great. It tastes like grape pixie sticks. The feeling is smooth and very relaxing. As a hybrid you expect a little sativa and indica but this one is mainly indica feeling without the feeling of sleepiness. Definitely recommend this flavor over other flavors.
222,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月12日,Good product!
223,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月12日,"If you like cheap gas station vapes that taste like a stale sugar free gummy bear, then you will love this. I spent $112 just to throw this directly in the trash. I don't even think there is any THC in this because there is 0t even the slightest bit of essence of marijuana. I knew as soon as I opened it and smelled the nasty fruit smell that I was 0t going to like this, I tried to do an even exchange for a pure strain in the same brand and was told 0 so I tried one hit and couldn't even..."
224,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月24日,The bud was good I used it to relax
225,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月14日,Worked really well for numbing my back pain and helping me just chill out.
226,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月13日,Taste profile ebbs and flows. Some are alright...others taste like drinking a bottle of bubbles from the dollar store.
227,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,"All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
228,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月10日,Ok
229,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,The product lasted for a while. Literally tasted like a blue jolly rancher. Recommend for helping you finish those last minute papers.
230,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月18日,Pleasant with an indica slant to it.
231,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月12日,"1, very much so"
232,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月2日,awesome flavor
233,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月23日,Blue Burst is my favorite of all the Stiiizy flavors!
234,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月7日,Favorite flavor so far.  Great high and taste good.
235,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月16日,it has a very fruity taste and has a nice high
236,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月8日,Wish the pod itself worked better!  Many defective
237,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月16日,"Taste like a blue starburst, great high too"
238,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"My blue burst pod was a dud, this isn’t a bad thing but made me realize, if your pod doesn’t work, keep your receipt and head back same day, D2 employees will gladly help you out (same day) 
The flavor is super strong and taste like a refreshing spoonful of blueberries, it’s a distillate oil pod with a great taste and a high that hits right in the head, the taste and strong high of course, makes this worth buying in a gram pod, pick this up with a blue battery and rep that BLUEBERRY STIIIZY! ��"
239,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,The high is good but I don't like the taste
240,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月29日,"It was new packaging and I feel like it went quicker than the other ones. But other than that, it still tastes good."
241,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月26日,"I don’t k0w if Stiiizy changed something up recently but 1. This doesn’t taste as good as blue burst has for me in the past just by a little and 
2. The oil seems thicker, longer lasting. I’m happy!"
242,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月5日,"Great taste, almost like a grape/blue raspberry flavor. Would buy again."
243,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月5日,Great taste and good pod to use while getting tasks done around the house or needing an extra boost for creativity !!
244,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月3日,good (-:

250,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月10日,"Overall good, tasty. First time trying a Stiiizy product. Battery and set up is  easy and discreet. Sometimes it seems to get plugged up."
251,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,Loved it! It's my go to.
252,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,My favorite

256,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月4日,One of my favorite flavors! very smooth refreshing taste
257,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月27日,"Description of product says “blue Gummy” bu when I got the package it said “blue raspberry” ? Idk it might be just me, but the taste reminds Me of the Old school “Flinstones” Vitamins you would find in your grandmas medicine cabinet ."
258,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月12日,my favorite flavor so far
259,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月10日,Great taste and terps but doesn’t get you too high. Idk just my experience.
260,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月7日,"0t much of anything, almost as if it was on the low-low end of some form of dosage."
261,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月7日,0t as strong of a high I was looking for but it did ease my mind and made me really chill. The flavor is pretty good too.
262,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月9日,"Very nice, even high as described. Would purchase again!"
263,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月5日,Product was amazing. Tastes so good
264,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月5日,Great tasting product with even better results. Perfect one for me to do the job and keep me active.
265,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月27日,This was my 1st try with this hybrid. It's nice. It actually was quite helpful with some digestion issues I had. K0cked the nausea out fast. I appreciated that greatly. The flavor has a slightly odd aftertaste. I'd call the true flavor 'burnt raspberry'.
266,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月25日,TASTED FIRE
267,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月23日,Tastes nice :)
268,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月27日,tastes like skittles or blueberry gummy
269,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月17日,"this flavor is very tasty in my opinion, one of the best tasting stiiizy ive tried so far, goes well with an energy drink"
270,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月3日,BERRY GOOD STUFF...ENJOY
271,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月8日,"Great Strain , Definitely will enjoy lots"
272,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月1日,Blue dream is my favorite �.   Great taste & effect!
273,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月1日,This cartridge got me in a place that I could enjoy.
274,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月14日,Taste is too strong and smoke is harsh. Stays charged longer than lime though
275,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月28日,Product was great in making me relaxed. Only complaint about this vape pen is that it gets clogged from time to time. I would buy more but it’s a real bummer when you try to activate the vape pen and it’s clogged.
276,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月19日,"This was a great disposal pen 0 charging ever need good consistently till the end!
My new favorite!! Will buy again."
277,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月16日,Didn’t k0w if I would repurchase a stiiizy so I started with a disposable starter pen. It worked out for me because I ended up decided to buy a battery and pods for the stiiizy.
278,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月9日,"An amazing strain. Smooth and delicious! Definitely works wonders if you microdose throughout the day. Convenient and easy to use, would definitely recommend 10/10 every time I’ve used it!"
279,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月26日,Great flavor. Super clean distilled vape. Stiiizy does a great job distilling and keeping high thc levels. Highly recommend trying any Stiiizy product.
280,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月2日,Got a great buzz from this one
281,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月10日,It was all good but it stopped working for me mid way through
282,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月5日,Taste is an 8 high is a 6ish l was high but wanted to be higher.....but it last pretty long only use it during emergencies. This pen makes me want to explore other vapes
283,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月6日,I love Blue Dream and the stiizy pen hits.

660,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月13日,I love the high this vape makes
661,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月19日,I am very happy with the products.
662,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月27日,Hey
663,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月6日,Hard to pull feels like Iâm going to collapse a damn lung cool idea tho.
664,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月5日,"Bought 2, 1 worked, one did not. Required bank intervention to get refund due to poor customer service. I want to like Stiiizy products but this makes it difficult to trust the brand."
665,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月11日,"This battery is horrible. cheap, low quality metal and it only stays charged for a few hours. no wonder they gave it to me for free at their patient appreciation."
666,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月21日,"I have purchased 3 defective pens from stiiizy, successfully exchanged 1. After the headache of the first exchange I just said F**** it and ate the next. As a medical patient, this really sucks. It took over a month to deal with customer service, and ended with my bank stepping in because of stiiizys bad business. unbelievable. I couldn't make this crap up."
667,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月20日,I have had so many of my friends tell me that this is the best one on the market..... I can assure you it isn't. The packaging looks cheap and the weed is just ok.
668,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月6日,"Bought a replacement battery since my last one stopped working. This battery stopped working just like the one before. The micro usb does not charge, no light shows when itâs plugged in. Iâve had it just about two weeks."
669,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月23日,"Honestly as a parent at times you need something to help you decompress. As the kids became older it became harder to explain why mommy and daddy had to take walks outside in turns to ""get some air"". These have become out life savers. Get some nice relaxation in, all without smelling. We still take our walks to get air BUT these hit so hard that it only takes a few minutes outside and no mess! Love you Stiz"
670,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月28日,"But seriously, besides being absolutely adorable, this pen is perfect! Iâm super clumsy and am constantly dropping my vape pens. Several times Iâve broken a full cartridge, but with this design, itâs really difficult to drop it at an angle that would break. Itâs also lightweight and discreet, itâs small/ slim enough to fit in even small pockets or a wallet. Another problem Iâve encountered with other pens is having to replace the batteries more times than I can count because the plate get pushed into the battery over time from over tightening when charging or connecting cartridges, but again, this design allows you to just drop the cartridge in, and it charges like a phone, solving both issues. I love it!"
671,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月6日,"I love how it looks with my freshly done manicure, I love how it looks when its just sitting on my counter, I love how it looks ALWAYS!! Im glad i treated myself with this.. she's gorgeous and discreet. Blows gorgeous Kush Clouds too btw.. I tried strawberry cough and fell in love! Cannot wait to try them all!!"
672,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月22日,"Dopest, sleekest, battery by the brand. Stiiizy's really supporting Breast cancer awareness with this one."
673,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月6日,"Stiizy is a really good product and helps me with even my worst pain, its my First and only pen. Hope they have plans in the future for a âACDCâ or âHarlequinâ High CBD Low THC Cart!"
674,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月23日,"couldnât wait to come back to LA & get my first STIIZY. & of course I wanted the rose gold, so sleek & lady like. I have no plans to go back to other pens that iâve used in the past. only thing i would possible want is a case? something small & compact that I can put it in to protect it while itâs in my bag. other than that, i am sold! customer for life ðð½"
675,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月9日,"Had an og Black one, bought this pink! Itâs cute, love it because the hubby has his black so we alway know whoâs is whoâs. Lol! Clean hits and charges fast! Definitely my fave!"
676,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月23日,"So, as for a general review of the battery, it's really good! It has a nice, discreet form factor, superb build quality, a battery that lasts for a good while and the pods fit perfectly into their slot and look very sleek. It works great with all Stiiizy pods, even the live resins. Now, as for the color, it's a very nice pastel pink with a smooth, matte metal surface. It's a really nice, calming color that's also a bit easier to find when you're looking your battery to take another hit."
677,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月20日,Blaze delivers stizzy pods and batteries ð !!! 40$ for thÃ© set and delivered sounds dope and theyâre fast ð¨
678,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月24日,"Itâs something for the summertime ! Super Smooth, but packs a punch. This may be a bias review because I love Rose anything and Stiiizy never disappoints. Great flavor, Great rip."
679,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月26日,"aesthetically pleasing, produces huge clouds, discreet, and I love that the pods dont leak/clog. Pods are potent and the whole system makes for an amazing on the go vape."

690,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年12月14日,Explendid customer service
691,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月26日,"Perfect size to put in my pocket, and really cute :)"
692,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月29日,I'm sure this won't break by the way it feels on hand.
693,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月31日,"Attracted to this coz it looks elegant, solidly built too!"
694,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月8日,nice and discreet!!! love the color and the feel
695,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月15日,I was having a bit of a hard time trying to decide which color to get. I thought I had picked the rose gold at the counter but I'm not trippin cos I really like this color and I'm happy even if it was a mistake cos this one is perfect...the purple seemed s bit too bright and the rose gold not girly/pink enough for what I was looking for. Perfect shade of pink because it's pretty discrete and is overall just a very classy color. Super lightweight so I can see how people tend to loose their pens really easily especially if you're hi af ð Glad I ended up picking up s stiiizy system cos (so far) I'm very happy with it since I also got it on Saturday when the batteries and pods are 20% off so it was $60 for the battery and 2 .5 gram pods ð
696,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月17日,"I quite like the stiiizy system. The carts taste better than a lot of 510 carts ive tried, although there are tons of brands that make 510 carts vs only 1 for stiiizy. The pros of this are that every stiiizy cart you buy will be pretty good because they all are made by the same company and that company happens to be pretty good. Another pro is that the carts arent too pricey, but this varies depending on where you are and what dispensary you are shopping at. The last pro ive noticed is that the stiiizy carts seem to last a long time, idk if its because a lot of 510 thread carts are under filled or something, but i got a half gram stiiizy cart to start out and i have been hitting it non stop and it has easily lasted a longer time than all 510 half gram carts ive ever had. And it looks like its still half full. The cons of this product are that there is only one brand that makes carts, so if the quality starts to drop then you cant just switch brands and keep using this battery."
697,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月7日,nice color
698,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月27日,Beautiful you need to get this color!
699,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月17日,"Slim, perfect, and love how its discreet."

702,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月28日,Simple and clean look. Doesn't look obnoxious nor make you look obnoxious.

710,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月10日,"Just got mine today and I'm officially in love! Discreet, cute, hits great & can fit in my wallet. #Winning. I chose #PineappleExpress as my first cartridge."
711,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月27日,This pen looks and works so good! it's perfect for my girly lifestyle and its so discreet. 10/10
712,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月20日,these like iPhones for vapes does such a good job and looks good
713,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月11日,This thing is awesome. Are used to have a PAx and I hated it. This thing kicks PAX ass. Cartridges are half the price. the oil is amazing.
714,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月7日,I was so determined to get this color and I'm so happy I waited!! It really looks better in person. I got pineapple express for my first pod and I wasn't expecting to hit so good. Definitely recommend!
715,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月6日,I love the stiiizy rose color battery! A little more expensive than other cartridges but worth it. Itâs so discrete and I love the color.
716,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月2日,It matched with my phone and itâs super cute.
717,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月25日,"I love my rose gold Stiiizzy. I also agree, Strawberry Cough is an amazing sativa. My highs last pretty long and that makes me happy. I get things done and I feel creative."

719,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月7日,"the best pen got a few colors rose, blue and black. they all work good"
720,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月25日,I had tried their products while I was out in Cali & loved it. They definitely need to bring their product over to D.C & Maryland Dispensaries!!
721,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月17日,I want to order??
722,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月17日,Dope finish! I'm rocking the Rose w/black lanyard. Vice versa. The ROSE finish is platinum!ðððð¤£ð
723,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月7日,"Treated myself with this little guy, itâs so small, sleek and lightweight! The color is so elegant and modern, hits beautifully and I definitely recommend."
724,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月7日,I love my pink battery. It almost looks silver in the sun and is very light and cute!
725,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月6日,"The pen is gorgeous in person and feels pretty to hold, but is a bit slippery."
726,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月30日,ððð¥my girl loves it
727,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月22日,"I have been using batteries for years and this was my First Stiizy purchase. I am SO DISAPPOINTED with this particular battery, the magnets used to hold the Hella expensive pods are WEAK!! The first day I had it I stored it in my bra, this is where I put all of my batteries when I don't have pockets. Anyways, ran several errands and when I pulled the battery out to hit it. There was NO pod attached, It had fallen off and I didn't even notice!!!!! $50 gone!! Come on Stiizy, this is a joke. The quality of the oil is hands down Bomb asf BUT for their price you need to do Better with the batteries!!!! I have another brand of battery and the magnetic is so Strong that I've NEVER lost a cart or even have it come detached from the battery even after dropping several times. I'm now a little uneasy about buying more pods for fear of them falling off. I don't have money to be throwing away. PLEASE Stiizy, do better and change the Structure and Quality of the batteries."
728,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年11月12日,The battery will charge red and show it being dead but after the 45-60 minute time period it will still be dead and wonât even turn on white when hitting with pod
729,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月8日,"Itâs a nice battery I like how it charges with an android charger so if it dies on me I can get ahold of a charger pretty easy, easier than it would be if it was the standard 510 thread charger . I love how itâs available in different colors . Just wish more cartridges were compatible with this battery .. but all in 5 out of 5ð¤"
730,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月1日,Just picked it up today for $20 way out in the middle of nowhere. Just happened to be in the right place at the right time!!! Plus orange is my favorite color ð§¡ð§¡ð§¡
731,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月14日,"Quick charge, reliable hit, and good design; Iâve recommended it to multiple people who also love it."
732,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月16日,I've got four batteries and this one is easily the best. So easy to charge with the chord provided; it takes around an hour to fully charge again. They are also pretty sturdy and can take moderate abuse.
733,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月31日,AFTER LOOSING 5 BLACK BATTERIES I DECIDED TO GO WITH A MORE VIBRANT COLOR AND THIS ONE WENT BEYOND EXPECTATION ð¯ð¯ðð

754,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月26日,Greatttttyt
755,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月30日,"This pen is cutting edge and the best for me so far. Sleek and powerful this battery lasts me a week on two short charges. The charging port is an android charger which is very convenient. The cart is magnetic which I also like. I still have my âcanâ pen since I havenât been able to find another brands making carts for stizzy pens. My tender hooked me up with a nice Stizzy bag and lanyard. The lanyard came with a stizzy pen rubber holder so I donât lose my pen, which apparently happens since theyâre so slim and small. Maybe a find my pen app? Need help contact me."
756,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月16日,low key they hi key pens just wish battery lasted longer
757,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月10日,"Great design. It feels awesome in my hand. But, invest in this only when you are ready to leave all others behind. 510 threads are everywhere, making them very easy to switch and try new varieties. The pod is better preforming, but limited to certain brands. So, are you a Stiizy person? I am not a brand person, because each oil brand has given me both positive and negative experiences, so I like to shop around. With this battery, I can only buy their products. That would be cool if their product was premium, but even the bud tender suggested a different brand. I just had to try it for myself.... itâs not premium, it just tastes great. Now I have a battery that I might never use again, unless I decide to give your oil another chance."
758,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月7日,Did the job
759,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月4日,got one on the first of the month what I like about it is that it's small and easy to hit my biggest complaint about the pin is that I have to charge it every other day and on top of that the cartridge I got witch was hard core og don't taste good at all to further note that all of my other pins that I have I can smoke a full gram before I have to charge them what's up with that
760,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月20日,the battery is going to cartridge last about 5 times then it will
761,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月20日,The camo finish feels as if itâs slip resistant. A lot less likely to slip out of my hand than my red one. ðð»
762,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年3月1日,I love this battery just wished I had the bigger one haha
763,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月5日,Camo finish looks amazing and feels great in the hands. Long lasting battery. 100%
764,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年10月15日,"Lost my device, Got this, love how it looks and i can vouch for its durability"
765,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月31日,"The camo colorway fits my style!, besides that this works as advertised. No issues"
766,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月23日,This starter kit is amazing! Love the design!
767,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,I got this cause the camo design rockkksss! Build quality is... well premium. Feels solid on hand
768,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,"Best looking of the bunch. I mean that's not just my opinion, i usually get compliments on how nice this looks"
769,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月7日,Love the cameo style of the pen! Will probably get one for my brother!
770,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月15日,You gotta say this got style
771,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,"Fire design, I don't think you can dislike this"
772,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月11日,"Looks great, feels premium! Works well."
773,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月30日,"I like the whole camo thing, certainly eye catching. Device works as expected."
774,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月30日,The Traskmaster approves of how this device looks!
775,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月30日,Now this here device deserves more love!
776,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月15日,Something about the Camo design speaks to me
777,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月25日,"Works perfectly, love the looks on this one. Solid device"
778,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月15日,"Works well, battery lasts long and that camo looks great!"
779,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月27日,"I prefer bigger Stiiizy batteries, but if you want something more portable and lowkey, this does a pretty good job. Love the design!"
780,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月10日,"I love this design! Build quality is great as well, but it's the Camo that convinced me to grab this!"
781,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月20日,"the taste is a bit ugly, but good stiiizy"
782,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月8日,Makes an awesome product from the battery to the cartridges I see a lot of people on here say the cars go fast 510 Last me two days a pod last me almost 3 sometimes four
783,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月29日,"love mine i shouldâve purchased sooner, hits well and carts are affordable. bad thing is that it seems like it does go through carts quite a bit faster than a regular 510 battery does. shouldve got the orange or any bright color instead tho bc it blends in with everything so i lose this one all the timeð"
784,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月17日,"Poor rating for the batteries yall. Just take care of your batteries. Keep your rubber tops for the bottom of your batteries as well as for the top and bottom of your carts ya digg!? Lord knows how much crap can end up in pockets. Don't OVERCHARGE! It doesn't take long sheesh. Been rockin 2 black batteries since. Now I'm rockin the Rose w/ the black lanyard. My next one is going to be a Red battery for my Sats! Fasho! The finish on these batteries are so amazingly done. I might just get a blue one for those evening Indies. Cant hurt to have back ups. They normally last me a couple days before I have to recharge. Brids are on the Rose and on the rise. Ha ha! .... Sorry I had to do it... It's about color coding too people. On the carts I use red, green, and purple sharpies to fill in the lines but for the most part my tastebuds know my favorite kines. You know what would be dope tho is if the lines where color coded red, green, or purple. JGEAH! You know my STIIIZ!"
785,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月29日,I bought a blue one a week ago and have had that time to use it every day. Iâve been researching different strains and flavors and just ordered more cartridges and a second [red] Stiiizy battery as a backup/spare. I love the gentle hits I can take and I feel like I can better control my dosing. Happy
786,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月5日,"This pen is so slick and portable I take this thing everywhere. I still live by other cartridge, wax, etc. pens, but this makes the vaping so effortless. The pods can switch instantly, they attach to the pen magnetically. The pen itself is only on when you breathe thru it, no buttons. The pods seem to last quite a while, don't need to breathe in long to get a decent hit. 10/10 my dude"
787,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月14日,Love the color and how quickly it charges.
788,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月14日,I have silver and red. They do charge fast and seem to last a good long time. I use them with live resin pods and they work very well.
789,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月23日,This is my first stiiizy battery and my opinion on this is that the color is sexy asf!!!ð I love how itâs simple asf and itâs pocket sized and you can take it anywhere. I truly recommend this for starters who like red.ðâ¤ï¸
790,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年1月14日,I donât really like pods because it limits youâre selection but I did however like the convenience of it . Would recommend!
791,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月13日,In Hawaii and tryna get ahold of some of them! If you can help that would be great!

795,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月7日,My bestfriend was surprised when I got him this for his Birthday!
796,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,I went to check to see what the buzz is all about cause I thought it's just another fad and boy I was proven wrong with your products
797,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,Investing on STIIIZY's starter kit is the best investment I've made far as the product's great!

810,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月29日,Matches with my product red Iphone and just as reliable!
811,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月15日,Why this isn't as popular as the black device is beyond me. Red looks awesome
812,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月15日,My first device from Stiiizy - still working a few months in

824,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月26日,This color is dope ð¯
825,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月27日,my favorite color battery by far
826,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月8日,theyre are so dank
827,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月31日,The best
828,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月8日,First pen I got as a stiiizy and I absolutely love it.
829,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月19日,Ive been using mine for about 3 months and itâs sikk af even though the white light gave out it rips hard would recommend
830,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月8日,i have to say it hits really really nice almost fells like inhaling nothing even when doing a blinker but the battery does not last very long even when just doing straight pulls [not a blinker] it dies rather quickly so make sure to charge before going to a sesh or when you ride solo other than that it is a great battery would fully recommended
831,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年6月4日,"a good battery, it hits well and i feel like i get a good hit even when itâs almost dead. it does seem to die fast or maybe i donât charge it long enough. also if you leave your cartridge on while charging it does waste a little bit of it so be aware of that. but i like the one guys idea of having a few batteries for the different strains so i might do that"
832,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月16日,is there anywhere else i can purchase one besides there web page ?
833,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月12日,"They wonât even reply when shop is open, been waiting 5 hours of texts and emails and still nothing"
834,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月20日,"I had ordered the red stiizy battery online and then when my order had arrived, I just got the regular black one that I already owned. :/"
835,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年6月23日,"I bought this vape and 3 pods, it was great for a day or two but after that every pod I dropped into the battery started to leak into my mouth and then eventually just forced itself out of the pod on its own. I never charged it with a pod in place and always left it in the upright position. I do not recommend this product for the price of the pods especially if they just leak everywhere."
836,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月2日,"so I purchased two batteries, one for my girl and I. I love the thing they're really low key and great on the go when you just trying to sneak a toke. Unfortunately, my battery went out 8 days later. Lights won't turn on or charge.. sucks man.."
837,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月9日,"I have been using my Stiizy for 4 months now, and am about to put it down for good. Body: the body of the battery looks very sleek, but it's surface is slippery and hard to hold onto. Combined with how thin and light it is (cheap aluminum construction) the included lanyard is necessary. The lanyard is honestly the best part. Performance: for a proprietary product, it leaves a lot to be desired. It has consistent connection issues between the battery and the cartridges no matter how clean the contact points are. Over time this becomes a consistent problem. The carts also clog very easily. For every three hits I take It having to unclog it and it is really frustrating. Add to that the carts seem to be very inconsistent but mostly on the weak side, and it makes this one to avoid."
838,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月8日,I bought the red stiiizy pen and a week later it stopped charging out of nowhere. Donât know what happen to it just stopped charging. Do you know the problem or what could of happen?
839,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年8月31日,great prices an deal they hooked me up
840,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年8月7日,swift drops Active 24/7 Sna.pch.at: Ha.rdO.z7.10 tel eg.ram: HardOz.7.10
841,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年8月29日,Apparently everything that is advertised for Curaleaf for the pick up on that girl is not available they donât have it and everything is incorrect. It is advertise on Weedmaps and has been for a year according to the associates so my review is -0
842,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月20日,"Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa! No more sneaking out on the room and go to the bar and open the cabinet under the sink and reach further just to get the lens box and pick a flower and grind it then pipe it then go outside to smoke 5 times and go hide it again and go to restroom and drink a glass of listerine just to elimanate the smells and go back to the room and get to bed. While gf asleep. But this one is awsome! Iâll tell her Iâm just go wee-wee, then open the sink cabinet and reach underneath to grab the pen w/ velcro and smoke 3 times, no smell all good go back to bed. From 30mins to 3mins. Brooo wtf!! Iâm flyyyyyyiiingggggggggg! Ultimate Mind Blown. Life saver! And Time Saver!!! Stiizyyy is the best!!!"
843,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月22日,Starter kit sounds like its a WHOLE set up. VERY MISLEADING FOR ALOT OF PATIENTS. Whats so hard about calling it a battery on the box.. GEEZ
844,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月26日,"After a few uses it pays for itself, people claiming it leaks have to realize their salvia has to go somewhere, right? Make sure your lips are dry and your cart wonât âleakâ. I assumed it leaked as well however moisture does travel I like the design itâs sleek and discreet. Awesome magnetic ð§² snap on pods that tastes great and clean. For only around 25 bucks depending on your dispensary you get a cool, quick charging, automatic puff detection; no need to hold down a button because the way it works is simple yet very efficient, you simply âpuffâ away and it lights down to let you know when itâs time to be charged. Very fast minimal charging time, decent battery life for the small physical size of the battery. Overall a good product from an awesome company that is setting the new standard for quality."
845,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月9日,this thing is amazing. if you're going through a pod in a day wow get a life or a job. I can't believe somone would suck on it all day thrn complain it doesn't last.
846,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年1月4日,"Love the battery. It's not as resilient as I would like - had one break because the two contacts inside the battery seemed to fail and no longer cobust the product. STIIIZY support was awesome and got me another battery replacement from my delivery guy. They reached out and contacted the business to get it set up. I love the look of the product, great overall design."
847,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月8日,"The plastic is cheap. Once you get past the wow phase of the sleek design the problems come to the surface. Battery dies faster than any pen Iâve dealt with, 3 or 4 pulls and you can feel the tip getting so hot that sometimes it even spits the oil onto your tongue and this thing is a magician, your pod can be gone in a day and a half not even at times. Cool design, definitely needs a lot of work. I wouldnât suggest this without doing your own research cause everyone else would have you believe its godsend but in my honest opinion after buying 20-25 Iâm done. Unless they redesign the pods I wonât be coming back"
848,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月18日,"I LOVE that the pod isn't glass because I have dropped it 3 times so far. It hits hard and very smoothly and a little goes a long way. In my area most places seem to sell it, and everyone has been out of the Plug Play, so I finally decided to give it a try. I am happy with it overall. This unit is physically lighter and a bit sleeker than the Plug Play, and doesn't require you to push a button to hit, but I feel like the hits are slightly harsher with the Stiiizy. With both I'm a bit leery of having a battery than can ONLY be used with ONE company's cartridge bc if they suddenly go out of business/stop producing quality products/raise their prices 400%/piss me off somehow, than I have invested in something I won't be able to use. Having said that, I have been very pleased with both thus far, and while I don't think Stiiizy is AS amazing as the hype suggested, the quality, style, and ease of use have won me over. A price decrease wouldn't go amiss though... ð"
849,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月3日,"If you're like me you been smoking a while you tried pre-rolls edibles things like that and they didn't cut it. This is the Solution right here, man. Charge the battery the ""Pen"", the STIIIZY for a couple hours and make sure to stock up during the sales at your local Dispensary, the PODS are addictingly good and hit every time. More expensive but way worth it. You could buy like four or five pre-rolls and still not get as high as these pens. All you really need is a few hits and you'll be ready to rock n roll a"
850,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月16日,Figured it was worth the 20 dollar gamble on the battery and 30 (at my shop) for pod was worth the gamble for something portable and discreet... I was very happy to find it went above and beyond my expectations. As a hater of vape products and a skeptic of the content quality /quality of builds I have to say Iâm impressed. May have even changed my opinion on vapes.. actually feels like a dab and battery lasts a min. Very pleased.
851,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月21日,Smooth Very relaxing Need to make pods cheaper but good quality product
852,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月25日,tengo un sobrino que le dan ataques de epilepsia y la verdad quierara tratarlo con mariguana no se que tan recomendable sea
853,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月25日,Stiiizy pls hook me up with some free stuff so I can do some in-depth reviews. Your battery is an amazing instrument that is revolutionary. Try a hybrid with your first dose of this amazing medicine.
854,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年5月3日,Had a great experience ordering from them. Had a nice chat with the driver and got a free pre roll! Couldnât have gone better. Definitely recommend !
855,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月11日,"I like how it lights up when you place a cartridge inside. I was sold a fake cart recently and when I loaded it in it lit up blue instead of the normal light, thus notifying me that something was up."
856,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月14日,awesome sauce thanks for supplying great quality producta
857,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月5日,"Greetings, ya'll. I come here to emphasize that the 2 BIIIG batteries I purchased were awful and would never maintain connection with any size pod. THIS battery does the job. take a small hit every 30 seconds (minimum), and it doesn't overheat the pod and expertly delivers the hit."
858,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月21日,I love the new colors they just released I bought the blue one today I love it so much ! I had just bought 2 pens (black edition) cause of I only smoke stiiizy !
859,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年5月22日,Discrete and does the job!
860,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月30日,Absolutely love it and the price is so after.
861,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年3月4日,"Iâve always smoked flower and have tried many vapes, this is the first one to work for me. Love the pod system!"
862,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,Gonna start vaping since I dont want my car to smell so much
863,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月20日,I normally prefer flower but I just got this starter kit and it has been so awesome to travel with. Charges quick and has a cool slick design that's easy to carry on your person.
864,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月2日,"Powerful & delicious. Please release an array of Sativa strains of LIVE RESIN. Doing great, guys."
865,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年12月2日,"what more can I say? doesn't break the bank, comes with the charger, hits unbelievably smooth and nice, very DISCREET. you can't beat it, STIIIZY is the best! I love THE SVF OG INDICA for bedtime. STIIIZY all the way! :)"
866,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月15日,"What can I say? This is just the best out here that you can get. Very small and discrete, perfect for daily smoking. Iâd 200% recommend"
867,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月17日,love the sleek design of the planned it's very discreet and I'm able to use it in public which is a huge plus for me since I'm a medical marijuana patient of 10 years plus I wish I'd gotten it in the rose color though black cool though ððð¯
868,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月15日,i just bought this today and literally the first fucking hit got me stupid faded. absolutely love 10/10 would totally recommend for everyone with the original battery pack to update
869,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月19日,Fire as fuck I bring this shit into clubs and smoke fat ðððððð
870,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月1日,when i first bought the stiiizy I admit I was a bit skeptical. the Sleek small design of the unit and Battery are seriously misleading . I can't believe how powerful the battery really is and the wax is of the best quality. thank you for making an awesome pen
871,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月22日,I Love the whole idea with Stiizy I think there a very good company and these Stiizy products are my life I need one but because of where I live I can't get ahold of one someone please help!
872,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月26日,"Iv been with my stillzy for about 4 months and it finally stop working, like it stopped charging. Cant really complain because Iâm always dropping my stillzy and it never broke until last week. I went to the shopping thinking I was going to have to buy a new stillzy, but they replaced mine and gave me a new one ! The stillzyâs are great ! Always coming through at work or getting me through a rough day."
873,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月20日,These batteries are great. Super convenient and the pods pack a punch. Hopefully they become more available across other services as itâs occasional hard to come by if the few places in the area are low on stock. If you charge the battery soon after it changes to red it only takes about an hour to recharge. Probably need to charge it every 2 days but I get heavy use out of it.
874,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月4日,"i love this pen, i came up on one while at Coachella, dope af, hits great, hella danky cartridges"
875,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年5月19日,Never had a problem with it. Lasts usually 2 days and charges in 40 minutes this battery will last you if you follow the instructions in the users manual. The thin sleek design is perfect to stash anywhere smoke anywhere discreetly.
876,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月26日,does anybody know for how long to charge a stiiizy starter pack? is it possible to over charge it???
877,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月3日,I got this as a valentines gift. My battery last me for 3 days. Wow. I love this pen ð
878,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年11月4日,Let me start by staying my battery came charged and ready to use out the box ð¤thank you for this I don't want to charge a battery before I medicate ðð this is innovation at it's finest â­â­â­â­â­ it also comes with a user friendly guide and the USB cable to charge it when not medicating ð

890,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月7日,My fav vape pen! Iâve only had the one and itâs lasted me a year already. The carts last for ages. Always worth the money.
891,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月21日,"This dude went through some tough conditions, and it pulled through."
892,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月5日,Iâm an idiot and didnât realize there is a magnetic connect haha. Works great even months after buying! Love Stiiizy!
893,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月18日,My Stiiizy Battery never fails. It holds a long charge in comparison to 510 threading batteries. I love it and I have it in pink! Canât wait to order the Biggie

899,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月18日,"Hit all day everyday. Charged it when I got it, DO NOT charge with the Pod inside or else itâll mess everything up, and super discreet. Battery lasted me 2 weeks. Love it"
900,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月17日,"And honestly as did I ! I'd like to think I'm a pen aficionado, I have tasted most of the leading brands and even some non branded pens. I've always struggled with finding the one that could truly deliver the feels I've been looking for. I wanted something to ease me through the day but if needed could carry me to the moon and back. In my line of work I needed something discrete but still cool, and honestly ever since I stumbled upon Stiizy I've been a fan. I have tried plenty of flavors and the one that is currently in my poclet is biscotti I'm all over any indica that can help me through the day, and if needed take me to that place we all want to be at. you're welcome. and #StayStiiizy"
901,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年2月18日,"I love how it uses a regular charger, you could literally use any Android charger and it works which makes it super convenient and you know you can take it pretty much anywhere. The instructions are very clear and straightforward. I've had this for a little over 3 weeks now and have had no problems with it or any of the Stiiizy pods I've bought."
902,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月6日,Yo this pen change my view on vape pens. Super good hits and the battery seems cool as well. The color and design baffles my mind itâs easy to conceal and gets the right medication every time. Thanks.

930,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月22日,Solid pods and my battery has lasted me over a year. Reccomend for sure ð
931,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月18日,I have tried several different vape cartridges made by different brands. Stiizy is definitely one of the better ones I tried. At first I was put off by having to buy a starter kit. I thought that was lame but considering the design (pods) are totally different than other brands I gave it a pass. Glad I did because the product in the pods is very good and that's what counts in the end. Worth a try.
932,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月17日,Great product
933,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月3日,I love this brand and hate to see its reviews so low
934,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月22日,last for a full gram pod and has a consistent heating of the oil.
935,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月20日,loving my kit nobody knows when I'm smoking

937,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月11日,Love my STIIIZY my best friend gave me one for my birthday. I love that I can carry it in my pockets when outside doing my yard work. No more wasted product. If this had been around in the 70's I would have own one then.
938,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月17日,love stiizy cartridges...airflow is perfect and can be suspenseful with a unepxected huge rip!

950,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月26日,I just wish the battery would last longer like me. It is well hidden I can if it in my wallet if Iâm in front of children so they donât see what it but itâs amazing and so small I can take it anywhere
951,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月11日,great quality and easy to store away

965,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月3日,"took to vegas for the weekend and it worked great. the battery could be better, but at the same time it's not a button like my alpine battery. Ethier way the sleekness makes up for it. this is my night pen. for when I'm going some place nice. use your other batteries for every day use. very satisfied with Stiizy vape pods as well, flame"
966,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年2月25日,First Iâm very fond by the packaging of the vaporizer. This mini vape is powerful. Quick charge and go. Very discreet no one will know your consuming cannabis. Nicely done STIIIZY

970,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年11月28日,"I like the light feature of the battery and it is extremely easy to lose in your pocket. Super plus for me because instead of losing pen somewhere else, it ends up deep in pocket every night, no matter how hard the party goes."

1021,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月8日,"Super Amazing flavorful fat clouds!!! Refilling the pods for the Stiiizy is very easy to do, much more worth it to buy the 1g syringes and refill when needed! Definitely a great choice at a low cost."
1022,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月2日,"Hello, Iâve had two pods one battery. Neither pod was smoked properly. Imagine hyperventilating on a pod thinking this time itâs going to work! You inhale a puff, hold it a beat and exhale.repeat this process 10 times. You may hit 3 puffs of product. All 10 inhalation goes to your head. Iâm I buzzed??? YOU bet. Not from the medication. Iâm light headed from those 10 attempts. Moreover, I noticed the oil has been sucked out of the top holes!! OMG now the pod is sticky with oil. My lips have a thick oil slathered on them too. I needed dawn dish soap to wipe this oil off me and the pod. In the end, I liked the oil but the damn battery is killing the whole experience of the pod. Why would Stiiizy allow that to occur? Someone better get to working on those growing image problem before it goes viral. All the good hits taken by the lucky can not offset the voices of an unfulfilled medication experience had by the not so lucky."
1023,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年5月11日,Informative and had my favorite go to strains I felt like I was in good hands.

1036,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月24日,This pen is fantastic in every way you can think of! Best on the market right now I will only be purchasing my pens from Stiiizy ðð¾ Great product
1037,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月14日,"Stiiizy, this small pen feels like taking a mini dab and it really hits hard for being such a tiny battery and pod. Love the battery life too!!!"
1038,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月10日,Wow
1039,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年11月30日,Very sleek delivery system
1040,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年1月4日,unplug.
1041,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月30日,Ive been vaping for a while and needed a new battery.I decidedly try STIIIZY even though they have propiatary pods you have to use. As it turnet they are the best Iâve ever had! Surprised me. I bought the starter kit and 2 different pods. Easily best so fa for real true flavor and a great effect. Awesome taste. Zero pesticides! See if anybody else has that!They did dry my mouth out pretty bad. Only negative.Going to try all the flavors they have. Well worth it.
1042,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月20日,"Loved it, tends to go by fast if I don't have anything to do, the perfect travel pen. Easy to conceal and rips fat off a fresh cart. Can be a bit pricy compared to flower but on the go it can't be beat!"
1043,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年6月12日,I recently had to replace the Stiizy battery that broke after 6 weeks gentle use. The store manager did not want to deal with my problem so she said there was nothing she could do. I ended up contacting Stiizy customer service and they helped me right away. I submitted photos of my broken battery and Stiizyâs customer service arranged for a swap out of my old broken battery. Now I have a functioning battery. Thanks Stiizy
1044,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月25日,"Stiiizy checks all the boxes for me - discreet, packs a punch, tastes great, doesnât cost too much. Been using it consistently for months now with pretty much no issues aside from getting a fake pod every now and then. Only thing I could ask for is a better battery life, I find myself charging it a lot."
1045,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月13日,"Iâve had the same battery for years and never had a never a problem with a pod either. Stiiizi was my first try at a pen and I did abandon it to try other new supposed to be better pens more than once, but I always go back to the Stiiiz. I think their product is good and if it wasnât, I donât feel theyâd still be around. Stoners & Cannabis aficionados alike would support the company if the product wasnât true."
1046,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月6日,need rec arkansas 501
1047,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年3月6日,"Easy to store, only downside is no cart with it but itâs still a good buy :)"
1048,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年12月30日,"Love Stiiizy and the battery lasts me awhile before I have to charge it. But if your looking for something with a little more hit, go with the Biiig Advance Battery from Stiiizy."
1049,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月1日,little happiness for me)
1050,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月11日,mine works just right I just wish battery lasted a little longer
1051,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月20日,This is my favorite wax pen to use. Just wish the pod wasnât plastic. Once the pod gets near finished I can start tasting plastic.. but I get hella high after ð¤£
1052,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月11日,Nice little pod system. The oils are hella tasty. The 0.5 pods are perfect. The 1.0 pods clog all the time. The battery charges and fires nicely.
1053,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年12月7日,"3.5 stars would be more accurate, but I'm rounding up because I love Stiiizy. I like how discrete the pen is, but it doesn't have much power to it. Also, the magnets don't hold the pods super well. But with that being said, I definitely recommend this pen anyway!"
1054,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月5日,gave 4 stars bc it did hit properly but wasn't as good as hyped up to be
1055,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月19日,they got quality stuff
1056,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月31日,It's cool. I like it. It get me pretty faded. Love the feeling of their pods. :)
1057,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月20日,Really like the look of it
1058,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月7日,"I love it over all everything is great, I only wish they had more of a selection. Also the second time I charged my battery the hit was alot harsher than the first time. idk if I messed the battery up or if by some chance I turned the voltage up. but besides that it was great!"
1059,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月19日,"Love it, need it, I got it!"
1060,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月21日,"Stiiizy is a decent brand, they have a lot of marketing and dedicated patients, but I feel like they need to step up their game. The oil quality is great, but they should branch out a bit more"
1061,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月20日,Stiiitzy I'm coming for you
1062,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年5月23日,"I purchased my first Stiiizy and pod exactly a week ago on May 16th after a buddy of mine recommended them over the generic threaded cartridges. At first I noticed that the draw seemed clogged but it would hit after quite a bit of effort. After looking it up on google I figured I got a defective pod so I went and bought a replacement pod and it was still hitting the same. I transferred the pods to my buddies Stiiizy battery and the draw was great. Once you hit the Stiiizy until the light blinks it feels like you took a dab off rig. I contacted the vendor whom I bought it from and he said it was a matter to discuss with Stiiizy themselves and referred me to their website. Im waiting to hear back from them but Iâll update this review once I do but after looking reading reviews on separate websites it seems this is a common issue. Overall, itâs a potent, discreet, well-designed product when it works"
1063,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月25日,"Bought my pen 9days ago. Everything was perfect hit great perfect amount of smoke, nice smooth draws, but then I had to charge it and thatâs where it went bad. Hooked it up and came back to get about an hour later when I tried to disconnect it the whole casing came off exposing the wires while it was still connected and charging. It slid back on but now nothing wonât draw wonât work. Super bummed. Shouldnât of had this experience within 9days of purchasing it!"
1064,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月8日,"I love stiizy pods for the experience, accessibility and convenience of pricing but these damn batteries are always going out on me. At least three newish batteries wouldnât charge anymore. I shouldnât have to fix them for a long while if at all."
1065,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月20日,Clean look but the cartridge wiggles bc weak magnets keep it in. Wish I got a PAX
1066,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月30日,I like the idea of the pen but the cart wiggles and becomes annoying LOL FIX
1067,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月30日,love the discreetness but I found that the cartridge likes to separate from the battery so I'm constantly pushing the two back together in order for it to work
1068,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月7日,When I first got the stiiizy i was so excited for it but the pods tend to leak towards the end. Im not too happy with this product but the actual wax is bomb af strawnana is my favorite
1069,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年12月26日,I bit overpriced. Iâm lucky enough to where I donât pay more than $5 for these.
1070,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月7日,This is the1 you been waiting for!..
1071,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月21日,Donât know if itâs just the one I got but long story short is.....no fat clouds unless you take blinkers. I just felt like I had to inhale much harder than I had to with this one. The pods hit a lot better with the advance big battery kit so just spend the extra bucks if thatâs what your looking for.
1072,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月17日,"So far so good produces big hits , see how long it last olny had it a week why give olny 3 star"
1073,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月17日,Donât it hard enough for me kinda disappointed ð
1074,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月9日,it amazing when battery works only had mine for 5 days and stopped working out of no where?!
1075,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月17日,"Had issues with my battery. Wouldnât work consistently, would have to swap the cartridge out. It was kinda like a Nintendo cartridge, Iâd have to take it out and blow on it then put it back in for it to work."
1076,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月17日,"These are some of the best cartridges I have tried m, with that being said the battery wasnât every durable I had it for 3 pods and I struggle to get a hit out of it even if the battery is fully charged"
1077,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月2日,Maybe an hour definitely wish it would last longer. First day I used it was full charge and I hit it once and 30-40 min later I went to actually use it and it was dead. Definitely need a portable on you all the time. Took it to Disneyland and still had to have it charging in my pocket when I wasnât using it.
1078,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年5月16日,I purchased this battery six weeks ago and one of the internal connections snapped off after 3 uses. The darn thing wasnât even dropped. I took it back to the shop and the staff refused to do anything about it. Ended up buying another battery to finish the pods that I have. Iâll see how long this battery lasts.
1079,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月10日,Been wanting to try stiizy because i been hearing so much about it. bought the pen 1st and bought a biscotti cart couple days later. So 1st off the pen does not come charged its completely dead which was odd because every battery i buy is always somewhat charged when i buy it. 2nd when i charge it fully and try to pull for a hit it constantly keeps blinking red/white and not allowing me to hit it. I keep looking up trouble shooting for this issue and seeing if anyone else experienced this issue but i cant find anything. Really disappointed about this because the whole set up is 50$ and i cant even use it nor return it. Very upset about this iâll stick to ye old brass knuckles with a normal ass battery that actually works
1080,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月15日,"Unfortunately, the last two pods I have had has leaked when the pods were about half full. Anyone else is having this issue? When inhaling, sometimes the liquid will end in my mouth, it only happens when the pods are half way done."
1081,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年10月15日,"My battery lasted about 3 weeks before completely going dead, more specifically no longer accepting charge! I have a brand new pod I canât even hit, not cool!! Disappointing for sure... I Shouldâve gone with a less expensive threaded battery. 2 stars ONLY BECAUSE itâs fun while it lasts... :/"
1082,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月17日,"First of all they hype is in really this pen didnât get me super stoned. Itâs just a chill kind of high, I would like a refund for this to be honest."
1083,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月19日,Iâve had a lot of wax pens and this one by far is my least favorite.
1084,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年2月8日,hits smooth and never burns but the magnets fell out after a week. once that happens the pen is useless bc it cant hold the pods without the magnets.
1085,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月1日,Iâve cleared half of a sour diesel pod and 2 hours later it still hasnât hit I smoke a lot but there should still be something
1086,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月4日,This isnât nearly as strong as PP. My friend used Stiizy and heâs been a pothead since he was a kid so heâs got a super high tolerance. My PP kit blew him away in two hits.
1087,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月11日,"As ""normal"" as it looks, the hits are very airy and it doesn't give me the feeling of getting a hit nor the taste. I give it 2 â's because it is discrete looking."
1088,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月3日,2 batteries have gave me problems after normal use
1089,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月19日,Just picked up a Stizzy and was not impressed with the flavor and it really did not get me hightas other products i have tried.
1090,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月26日,I just bought my battery on Thursday and I was finally able to open it yesterday and try it turns out the magnet that connects with the cartridge is weak compared fo my brothers that has a stronger hold. Im pretty annoyed!!
1091,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年4月4日,I bought mine yesterday and mine doesn't work. it's fully charged but whenever I put in a cartridge it blinks red. am I doing something wrong or is it the battery?
1092,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年4月30日,"Lmfao!!! Everytime I hear about how the pod didn't last or it burned or leaked lol. NO PEOPLE! STIIIZY IS selling you .325 of a gram and calling it a half and if you buy the ""1 gram"" your only getting .75 of a gram!!! Wtf are you guys supporting these thieves for?? Left coast extracts and west coast cure pods both fit the stiiizy battery and bigger bang for your buck!!! Trust me im in the middle of a false advertisement claim against them!!! F these bastards"
1093,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月20日,"Worst pull out of any brands I have tried! Donât wast your money!! Yeah your 1g pod will last forever but you will be struggling to get high! Magnets are not even close to being strong enough letâs way to much airflow during a pull!! Ordered there upgraded battery of there official website and paid and extra 15 buck for shipping for (two day express delivery)!! Scam it took a week and a half to receive my order!! Worst part is I expressed my displeasure to stizzy and they just had a bunch of excuse (covid/getting order ready? Almost seemed like a auto response, Also took about 5 emails to get a response in 5 days!! So long story short shop companyâs that care about you!! Stizzy is not one of them!!"
1094,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年12月15日,"Do not call it a ""starter kit"" when it is just a battery. A real starter kit has everything you need."
1095,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月29日,Magnets donât pull therefore donât hit. Older models of this same product used to be better so they are just trying to save money. Very unprofessional
1096,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年5月29日,Still not strong enough to produce a decent size pull off the pod. The light starts flashing right when you get any vapor. And this is the BIIIG ADVANCED KIT. Lame.
1097,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月19日,Had no idea I had to buy the podâ¦I really wish it would ask (have an option) if youâd like to add pods.. I mean that would be Nice! So Iâm on the site and donât see that they only sell pods .. daaaame it lol â¦ ð¤¦ð½ââï¸Stuck with a piece ð
1098,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月2日,first of all starter kit NO you still need the pod! and wasn't charged when I got it charged it for 9 hours and still can't hit it. I don't know maybe it's defective. I reached out to my delivery peeps and they wanted a picture of what I bought and I still haven't heard from them!
1099,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月12日,"This might be nice for the beginner, so if you want a light buzz it's for you, but to me it's way to lightweight!"
1100,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月16日,"After having it for 4 weeks , the battery broke with light use"
1101,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年6月26日,"avoid Stiiizy products. I have half a cartridge left that will be wasted. their batteries are poorly assembled after less than a month of light use and minimal travel, the positive tab on the actual battery pack within the device snapped off somehow, rendering the whole thing useless"
1102,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月20日,I purchased my first starter kit and it only lasted a week before the battery would die after 3 hits. Super cheap quality for such high prices. I would not recommend.
1103,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月7日,Disappointed
1104,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年6月30日,Was great for about 2 weeks with moderate use and charging. Then it just stopped working. Would like help please. Storr manager won't help. Product is great. When it works!
1105,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年5月7日,"It takes a few puffs to get a good hit. I prefer a different vaporizer I have. I just wanted a cheaper alternative. Well I guess I got what I paid for. A cheaper and not worth the money I spend, vaporizer. I had high Hope's for this vaporizer starting kit but sadly I wish I could give this product a negative 5 starts. Not worth your money!"
1106,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月30日,"Have been using this with only one pod so far, charging it according to what it says and it broke before the first pod was half done. Not worth the cost if I canât even go through one pod before it breaks! So disappointed, a disposable is more reliable than this battery."
1107,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月23日,"Poor quality of the product, I do not recommend, has taken several times and each time the same."
1108,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年1月22日,I got a Big STiiiZY battery at new age on central and that sh#t just stop working after to pods and within 4 months. and when I went to STiiiZY they told they cant do sh#t after a month. Don't get me wrong this sh#t gets you high as a star in the sky but I had more than one bad experience . the first pod I got stop working after one hit. So buyer beware.
1109,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月6日,Its upsetting to see this brand in so many illegal dispensaries.
1110,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月2日,Not working properly at all :(
1111,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年8月22日,testtetstsstststststststztztztstzttsts
1112,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月4日,"At first I thought this was just some hypebeast phallus sh!t make it bigger and pay more kinda thing, but actually this is worth the upgrade if you use it enough. For $20 more than the regular you get a battery that lasts significantly longer. Iâve heard âhits harderâ attributed as well and I donât know about that, it hits the same but you donât have to charge as often. The design is really cool and less juul, more itâs own thing, plus I think itâs more durable and harder to lose. Dope pen, highly recommended - plug nâ play sounds like a d!ldo stiiizy all the way lol"
1113,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月6日,Can yâall make different colored big batteryâs?
1114,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月22日,Not gunna lies this battery rips some good fucking clouds had mine about 4 months went tubing on the river got fully soaked just put that bih in thhe sun for couple hrs and the bitch WORKED AFTER GETTING COMPLETE GONE UNDERWATER ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð¼ðð¼ðð¼ð¥ð¥ð¥
1115,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月28日,these joints smack harder then my dads belt with the Grand Daddy Purpp few blinks and youâll be soaring
1116,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月15日,"It hits much better and bigger, but kills the kart quicker... Cause and effect"
1117,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月7日,"Ok so i started with regular stiiizy battery and love stiiizy but got tired of pulling so hard. So i got a Plugplay, and while it rips, i do not enjoy their design, or pods /selection. and for some reason they made me ð£my ð§  out! well i got a biiig and im SO darn glad!!! ð¤©ð the design...it feels so smooth and perfect in the hand! i love that there is no button. the hits are perfect for me ð¨ i missed GDP, og kush, sfv og, skywalker og, stawberry cough. and more to try!! right now im on ð­9! just popped in the best of all time delicious, GDP ðððð the flavor, the full, smooth rips and the high. I know you folks at stiiizy make $....but im excited to have a brand i trust, can verify thats super potent. thanks and keep it comming!!!!!! ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ððð ps...had to check 7 places until i found one!!! lucky me"
1118,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月19日,Stuff hits super smoothly. Little to no inhaling is required to produce massive clouds. As a first time after a relatively long tolerance break it definitely got me to where I wanted to be ðð.
1119,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月25日,"As someone with high tolerance, the stiiizy reg. Kit wasnât strong enough for me anymore. When I switched to this one I felt the difference when taking hits and I was zoooted..... and blinkers hit fire on this tooð¯ thanks!!!!ð¤¯"
1120,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月8日,"Soooooo soooo impressed, itâs been since pre-legalization that Iâve messed with vape pens , the high was always to wispy and short lasting. But a friend of mine has been raving about this biiig battery and stiiizy in general so yesterday I took the plunge and got a purple biiig battery and a Pineapple Express cartridge, I bought many live resins and a half zip of wonderbrett and alien labs and some hash but never got to any of it , I opened the big battery and pod first just to get a tastes â¦. After three huge clouds I was so baked, I spent the rest of the day just hitting my new banger of a battery and was high every minute of yesterday. Definitely buy one !!! Canât speak to the original battery but the big battery is a huge game changer!!!!"
1121,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月21日,"This is my first Stiiizy product, and I am enjoying how good my Stiiizy pod & battery hit. The Biiig Stiiizy battery has high voltage which results in making bigger clouds. The high voltage also burns the wax a bit faster, but can definitely get you high in a couple hits. I recommend this Biiig Stiiizy battery."
1122,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月15日,Stiiizy always comes out on top with the best products. This battery is great. Burns hotter and has a longer battery life. It is an advanced kit tho so if you mostly smoke the live resin pods Iâd probably just stick with the regular battery as this burns really hot and longer.
1123,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月22日,I was wondering if they check for id or medical card when being delivered. never used it so plz help.
1124,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月24日,Bigger is definitely better! Higher voltage more satisfying pull and bigger clouds! Love the color too! Build quality is awesome!
1125,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月26日,These are better and works great!
1126,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月27日,Anybody know where I can get one of the big stizzy batteries? Like what dispo or shop? Not sure if Acres has it but thatâs where I usually go
1127,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月16日,Theirs like 2 places in all of la that have these and ones a delivery so if you donât live out their they wonât come to you. And the the other place is far. So whatâs the deal stiiizy I live right by a couple of your authorized sellers and they didnt even know about these batteries when I called! You guys are always gonna get a 5 star for me cause it was like revolutionary for when I found you guys after dealing with fake nasty crap for so long but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get these batteries out their! I know why you guys made them! And I appreciate it! Stiizy>p&p all day!!!!!
1128,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年12月25日,"i had the regular stiiizy for a couple of months before getting the big one a week ago, and it was definitely worth it!! i had to charge the small one once a day and this one lasts so much longer. sometimes it doesn't recognize the pods and i have to draw for a while before getting anything out, but it's not that big of a deal. love stiiizy products!!"
1129,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月12日,this product is very good and 100% recommend for a thc vape
1130,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月27日,"Hits harder, Lasts longer! Totally more than worth the price!"
1131,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月29日,"I seriously havenât charged mine in like, 2 weeks and itâs still hitting strong. Absolutely in love! Hopefully they release new colors soon!"
1132,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月24日,Taking a blinker is like taking a fat dab.
1133,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月19日,"the big battery is really good. it lasts all day and before it just dies on you, the white light you see when you take a pull will turn red before the battery dies, it gives you time to smoke and not just be SOL. stiiizy is one of the best brands, quality and price are very very good."
1134,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月24日,I love the Biiig stiiizy bigger and better I hope they have more colors soon
1135,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月13日,IIITS HELLA FIIIRE YALL GET IIITð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥

1137,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年7月16日,Perfect might not have what I order but they provider me with some choices and recommendation and the other best thing that the driver was fast clean and professional I'll give it 100 Stars if I can
1138,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,Great product! Quality product! Cheap product!
1139,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年1月14日,"Certainly durable and works as advertised, definitely better for me than the regular sized ones"
1140,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年12月27日,good la neta si se las recomiendo
1141,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月13日,Im a newbie to this product. I find this impressive. Battery that could last almost a day. I can be high the all day. ;P
1142,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月26日,Great starter kit for newbies and a good deal! Worth the buy ð¤ð¤
1143,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年5月26日,This is power and hits harder. Great deal!
1144,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月23日,The best when available Recommend it to all my friends. Do you have battery charger only deals? I lose mine too often . No leakage problems !
1145,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月11日,"BIIIG does what itâs intended to do. I really enjoy this over the regular batteries as itâs way more powerful, but I always avoid the BIIIG battery when smoking live resin. BIIIG batteries pair perfectly with the OG or CDT pods ð"
1146,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年12月27日,If your not using this bigger battery then your doing it all wrong!!!!
1147,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月18日,This disposable stizzy.. Is great...so i can imagine what the rechargeable is like!!!...
1148,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月8日,âº with granddaddy purp goooooooooooooood~~!!
1149,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月27日,I love the BIIIG it hits so good almost like taking a dab! I ALWAYS keep mine on me and stay Stiiizyð¤
1150,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月30日,Great. Rips amazing. 5 second hits or less. On my other pens Iâd have to hit like 10-12 seconds to get a good rip ð big difference
1151,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月31日,"High quality, this battery is better than the starter pack"
1152,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月19日,"Super sweet, the girls here are so nice!! And itâs so professional inside! Iâve literally been looking everywhere, downtown and back for a stiiizy, and what do you know...itâs in my neighbor hood! Come here guys! You wonât regret it!"
1153,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月2日,amazing product love it's the smoothest vape pen that I've tried and I've tried several by far my favorite I would highly recommend to anyone it's just discrete the perfect size anything and everything a vape user would want in a product!
1154,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月8日,The batterie lasts a long time and is perfect for everyday use.
1155,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月5日,"im new to the vap word , just want to know will the dispensary deliver my new Biig Stiiizy to me if i order off line with the pods.."
1156,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月30日,The biiig stiiizy battery is amazing to use but you have to keep that it is bigger so youâre gonna go through your pods faster. For this battery full grams are the smarter option.
1157,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月24日,Just copped one of these biiig stiiizy batteries. And Iâm impressed definitely not as discreet as original battery but the biiig last forever and somehow regulates the heat a little better.
1158,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月15日,Nothing better than this biiig kit. Hits so hard highly recommend it pun intended.
1159,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月3日,"Can taste the pod better, bigger hits, big improvement from the first podðð¼ðð¼highly recommend"
1160,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月12日,Not now but right now
1161,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年6月2日,Fantasticâ¦ Once you get this; you got the Juice Now..
1162,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,Minimalist yet sleek. Battery lasts long enough inbetween charging/
1163,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,Worth switching for me. My previous charging kit kept on breaking after a few months and while STIIIZY's still works up until now.
1164,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月19日,"I like design for the cart, looks very durable, cause that mean it wont break in my pocket if I sit on it accidentally LOL"
1165,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月14日,"I love this device, it lasts long and charges fast. Glad I bought this"
1166,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月30日,Can't go wrong with big Stiiizy devices
1167,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月9日,This thing has seriously almost replaced cigarettes for me!! Awesome product
1168,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月14日,Bigger pulls makes for a big difference!
1169,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月30日,"I was was introduced to Stiiizy at a Sol Flower location in Tempe, AZ. Deal was buy a pod, get a standard battery. Never tried a pod, liked the sleekness, and Stiiizy rep was super nice. So instead of spending a comparable amount on a 510, bought a pod. I havenât tried any other pod types. But this thing hits beautifully. Absolutely perfect. Airflow, amount of vapor draw, flavor, effect, etc. Absolute primo. So I quickly bought the Biiig. Then when they came out with the CDT line, I am in love again. Thank you for opening up shop in AZ :)"
1170,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年5月16日,Duzn't leave your high hanging!
1171,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月27日,"You heard this before. Bigger is better. Definitely accurate. This device is built solid. Feels like it will last, Pretty good buy!"
1172,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月26日,i got the biiig gold edition definetly feels lighter than the original biiig edition
1173,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月16日,I love my stiizy i tried plug and play but stiiizy got me i love the strain specific flavors im always where i need to be with one of these i love both the original ang biig battery thing i love about the biig is u can rip it for 3 to 4 sec and get what it would take u to blink the old battery the new build quality is amazing i would love to see a stiizy mini just saying hahaha ððð much love stiiizy fam cant wait to cop a lanyard
1174,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月17日,Green on the go is exceptionally great for their stiiizy cartridges
1175,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年10月25日,They are the gift that keeps on giving. Donât deprive yourself of a stizzy these are wonderful. I am such a happy customer. I couldnât find anything difficult about it even for first time users. Plus the the design is just great!
1176,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月12日,My battery charges in about 2 hours and last well after a long day of use. I take this to shows and no one looks twice at it. Discreet and reliable!
1177,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月25日,the cutoff is set low so it keeps it from overheating I like the smooth draw and flavor is excellent quick charge that lasts for days with regular use. looking for an upgrade or something different give Biiig Stiiizy a try.
1178,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月20日,Ive tried the rest and the BIIG battery is well worth the cost. Hits hard and lasts long. I've had mines almost a 9 months before it was lost down a storm drain and have been trying to find one in stock ever since. Always sold out and for a good reason. Good work on the design and the build is pretty sturdy as well.
1179,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月3日,"Solid, speak, and packs a punch on the rip$$$$worth every penny"
1180,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月15日,"Listen she bulky a little but packs a PUNCH, you get good battery life and nice clouds ð¬ð§ââï¸ 10000/10 best battery Iâve owned, I even decorated with some stickers made it look dope"
1181,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月28日,I got mine in purple. This is my first time using STlllZY and I donât think Iâll be changing anything anytime soon! The Gelato Pod is my favorite!
1182,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月10日,Love it. Battery lasts longer and is more durable than the others. Would definitely recommend it
1183,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月5日,the battery hits so good when youre using it
1184,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月24日,Worth your money for the confidence and potency.
1185,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月5日,"its kinda light but the battery does last, dont call none of this self promoter losers sellin pesticides they some low lifes"
1186,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月6日,Lasted me a week before I noticed a dip in power no joke. Went through almost the whole cart on one charge. Super convenient
1187,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月7日,Battery last longer ð
1188,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月25日,This battery is a beast. Huge hits and long lasting battery. Canât go back to the small ones. Once you get the biiig!
1189,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月11日,"I could be smoking from the morning till night and it wouldnât overheat, Tun out of battery or something like that."
1190,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月4日,By far the best battery Iâve had hits hard
1191,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月30日,Love big stiiizy it charges fast lasts long and gives good rips still small enough to take everywhere
1192,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月14日,"The name speaks for itself you take BIIG hits with this battery!!! While still keeping that slick design. STIIZY definitely did this one right! My buddy and I call the hits when you wait for the light to blink, The Iron Lung Challenge. Iâm using mine with Sour Diesel doing a review for that as well. I recommend anyone this battery! Hit the #ironlungchallenge."
1193,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月26日,Love this one just wish you would drop colors now!
1194,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月16日,Best product ever:)
1195,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月22日,Man this pen is super legit!!! It actually charged faster than the smaller one. Bout that Stiizy life!!!
1196,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月15日,"never had a problem, always have fire shit worth the price, no leaks or anything so far from them amazing people always will be a customer"
1197,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月12日,NEED IT NOW
1198,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月12日,ITS LIT 550 battery ??!!!
1199,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年5月28日,"This is a product that is truly setting the trend on what people want in a vape. Itâs a smooth pull that is always consistent combined with a OG Kush Pod, Perfect! STIIIZY has been out running everyone when is comes to any cannabis products, just an all well fact! Much luv, Keep it up!!!"
1200,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年4月24日,"This battery is an awesome upgrade. it's got good air flow and gives you nice big hits. The only thing I wish was different is that the pod (1g) would sit deeper in the battery and not protrude out so far. I would like even better if it actually covered the pod completely so that no light could get to the oil. Its bigger then the original battery so it's harder to conceal. It also has a nice sturdy heavy duty design. So in conclusion, other than my personal opinions, everything else about it is perfect and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1201,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年4月5日,wow would really be interested in this.
1202,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年10月15日,"upgrades are always a good thing, upgrading to this bigger device is a no brainer"
1203,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年1月29日,first time I seen a STIIIKY was in Calif My niece just brought one and let me try it and I give it a ð and recommend to other Best in town
1204,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,"With a good battery, I can vape longer ð"

1212,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月16日,Friend recommend I try out pods. By far the best kit for noobs I have seen on offer so far! Big package for such a cheap deal!
1213,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月2日,I have but one complaint! A BIIIG kit should have a half gram sample of each of STIIIZY THC vape cartridges for free!!!!! ð¤
1214,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月14日,This device works great!
1215,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月3日,The best there is! And the customer service is amazing
1216,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月1日,dope battery life and fast charging only con is it is expensive
1217,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年6月30日,So far so good. Able to medicate discreetly
1218,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月18日,Instantly when I saw it I fell in love reminded me of the SMOK Nord and how powerful of a hit you can get from it. Once you get the Biiig Stiiizy Pak u just never go back because thereâs nothing u can compare to it. Long lasting rips and hits to your desired high love it wouldnât even think of anyone else.
1219,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月20日,Get customer service both Lori and Michael were very nice and had great product.
1220,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月10日,Got this battery as a PAD gift. I love it! Better hits and the battery life is ðð»ð¥ð¥ Wish they made different colors!

1231,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月20日,"Donât know why anyone hasnât created something such as this any sooner, definitely worth the coin."

1236,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月9日,I only had to charge it once.. Super impressed with its battery life. Most vapes I've used die so fast.. This thing lasted the whole damn cartridge
1237,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月25日,Great handheld device plus good wax

1246,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月15日,great battery matched with the best carts
1247,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月10日,dope products! really good stuff
1248,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月9日,BIIIG was a massive step up from the standard Stiiizy. The bigger battery gives it a cool beefy look and allows for a much stronger hit. Much more vapor is produced allowing for stronger effects. Only caveat is this product will drain through your pods at a significantly higher rate.
1249,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月6日,"I really liked the original Stiiizy battery. No contest though with the Biiig Battery. Great, huge hits. New favorite."
1250,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月2日,good kit
1251,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月1日,Itâs put my buttout it hits good looks Iâm going back for more today found the best spot
1252,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月29日,If youâre using Stiiizy and you donât have a biiigð I donât know what youâre doing with your life lol jkjk ð
1253,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月26日,If you are going to buy a stiizy it is a great idea to spend a little extra money an get this one over the regular battery ð
1254,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月24日,I like this one better than the rest. It can handle hard hits without overheating or getting hot. It has a smooth hits every time.
1255,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月23日,hits a lot quicker and better than the original stizzy. you can take massive rips and the battery life is inanse.
1256,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月22日,nice improvement from the original batteries ;)
1257,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月21日,"Being a traditional 510 Eleaf and Ccell Dart battery user, I will have to say I approve. The battery feels light and fits right in the palm when using. The oil quality and pods hit pretty hard and the pricing is about the same as any fire cart(s)."
1258,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月20日,GREAT BATTERY BUT VERY EASY TO BREAK !! I dropped it and both magnets flew out and I lost them other than that it is amazing battery
1259,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月20日,"Full bodied hits encase all stiiizy pods and offer a smooth hit I have tried the mango CBd def for more high medium feeling then next Iâve heard ,any great things about sky walker"

1296,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月7日,"Love the style the size and everything about it absolutely no problem. Only thing is when I went to get it from charging the first time. I pulled out the charger and the casing of the pen came along with it ! Wtf ? I thought it had broken. I pushed it back in place and it actually shocked me really good. Like zapped me, I was a lil scared to use it again but now I am extremely careful and I am going to get a case for it. Other than that itâs a solid pen, my I just bought a defective one. Also the magnit can be a little stronger on mine particular"
1297,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月29日,yo i love the new big battery too.. BUT MINE STOP WORKING AFTER LIKE TWO MONTHS BUMMED OUT TO SAY THE LEAST
1298,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月25日,I love this battery I would give it 5/5 if it didnât stop working and fall apart after a month of babying it
1299,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年10月24日,One of the magnets from inside the biiig stiiizy port fell out. It actually came off with the pod. So it was fun while it lasted.
1300,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月19日,"I love their products, it's amazing."

1305,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月24日,Battery almost never runs out
1306,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月19日,"it's been long I taste raw shits, they got me today."
1307,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月25日,"The advanced kit hits pretty good. The design is nice and sleek and easy to conceal., It's a nice vape as long as it doesn't die on me like most vapes have"
1308,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月9日,this shit hitts heavy as f** I kill about half g a day it's amazing but they go out if you hit them to crazy but still bomb I'll keep buying them
1309,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月2日,so far had this battery for 4 days now only needed to charge it the day i bought it. hasnt been producing less power its been consistent and i wonder when ill have to charge it again... wouldve gave 10/10 . But i just dont see how it hits better than the regular battery its like the same thing. only the starter kit would rip less once its about to die. i hope this one doesnt any time soon
1310,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月9日,"The new battery from stiizy is an anomaly. It's bases ahead of its previous revision with additional power and refined casing hull that's thicker and more hand comfortable. The first version had difficulties maintaining power thru the day with heavy usage. This battery now can withstand some abuse and still require more of your time. Problematic however is that it feels cheap. For the price point of $35, it shouldn't feel inconsistent on developmental quality which the first metal battery didn't encompass. It gets worst as the lazy engineering can't seem to get a pod to fit properly without movement when combined. The feeling of a misplaced pod may be a constant reality if your not careful. What this battery should be has passed. Maybe the next revision will implement these changes.Between both stiizy battery's this is the better choice by a slim margin."
1311,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月22日,"I was really impressed with this battery when I first got it, it was producing some really thick milky hits that were getting me super baked. After about 2 weeks, the voltage has already depleted and itâs not hitting any better than the original battery. In fact, it might be hitting a little worse, Iâm taking some long draws off this thing and itâs producing some pretty weak clouds and my high is not as good as it was before. I love stiiizy but this was a disappointment. Might just stick with the old battery"
1312,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月16日,serious guys why don't you have BATTERIES WITH A DAMN BUTTON.Sorry but pens that only hit when you draw just dont get that customized big hit.This is the one of the only reasons I don't buy STIIZY that much and when I do I get the SYRINGES so I can use a battery with a BUTTON. Hey but at least you guys sell your concentrates in SYRINGES cause I think every cartridge company should do that .
1313,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月16日,Donât get me wrong the battery smacks for sure but Iâve had a couple of times where It heated up my cart way too hot not to the point where I burn the wax but it was pretty warm but this one time I bought there live resin cartridge and almost halfway through the cartridge it burnt my wax they completely ruin the live resin cartridges.
1314,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年12月16日,Battery doesn't feel like it's significantly longer lasting than the original but hits like a champ. Sometimes changing the flavors profile of the hit you are taking. That could be both bad and good.. If you're new to the stiizy battery I recommend you buy an extra battery in the future
1315,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月31日,Yesterday 03/30/19 I went in to LA Kush collective in East La for a stiiizy patient appreciation day and it was buy one gram get a battery for a $1.00 so I bought 2grams and was able to get the new Biiig Stiiizy battery but unfortunately my battery is not working correctly.Went back to LA Kush and fortunately I was able to speak to the girl who was doing the Stiiizy promotion but unfortunately she couldnât swap it cuz she was out of battery she was a blonde girl but I forgot but she told me to write a review and see what you guys are able to do for me because the dispensary also didnât have the battery hope to hear from you guys soon PS your stiiizy Pods are still FIRE
1316,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月18日,Higher temp kills your pod more quickly
1317,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月10日,Uses and excessive amount of wax for no reason if u want something to get u super smacked then get a plug and play but otherwise the normal battery is fucking incredible
1318,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年9月10日,Idk if it just coincidence or not but right when I got the big battery my pods started tasting burnt
1319,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,everything was going great. my first time trying stiiizy products. after 10 days it no longer works. won't even charge. doesn't light up at all. very disappointed.
1320,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年11月5日,"I ordered & paid for the Big Stiizy, but received the small one. My husband was upset with me, cuz he told me to buy the big one! But he had already used it so I couldnât return it. ð"
1321,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月5日,"The BIIIG boy hits great, it hits hard, it hits you in your brain and in your toes, but it also doesn't hit 80% of the time. I have found that having to hit the smaller battery more frequently with smaller intakes. With the BIIIG, we have to grab any inserted pod with our teeth, and apply downward pressure to ensure it actually recognizes the pod in it. Lots of pressure. I have bought 2 for my wife and myself, and it happened with both. The pods used in these situations work amazingly on the STIIIZY regular batteries. I love the pods, but I am disappointed with this particular battery that doesn't seem to want to accept a pod, flashing it's lights at you all the way. If there is anything I want to stress, it's that the pods of either size and regular batteries work wonders, with many options of each. So go look at their reviews, and pass this product."
1322,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年7月11日,Charged the vape for the first time. When I tried to unplug the vape? The cord stayed inside and the entire outer casing came off! Electrocuted myself putting it back on. Unit should not fall apart in under 12 hours. Would love to get in contact with stiiizy over taking this to a higher authority. Been a user of stiiizy for over a year and I love the rest of the products.
1323,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月7日,Stizzy flavors are good but donât smack like a plugplay . FYI good luck smoking half grams with this one . I would smoke mine in like two days a day because it cart hot
1324,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月21日,I have purchased both the small battery and the BIIG battery and both have yet make it threw one tip before it stops working. I love the way it hits. I like the new style. BUT MAKE A BATTER BATTERY. I dont want to put out $35 every month for a battery to be able to smoke a .5gram! its crazy
1325,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月16日,great way for me to smoke through my cart faster. I finished a half gram in a day with this battery. what a waste
1326,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月28日,I bought the big battery today and the cartridge. Charged to white. Doesnât work
1327,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年6月1日,I ordered a big battery and when I got there they gave me the original one and I went back to see if I could get the one I ordered which was the big one and they said no it was a bug from weedmaps so now I just have the normal battery smh
1328,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月23日,loose booty vape battery
1329,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年1月28日,I bought this about a month ago and used it for about a week no longer works Light comes on but it does not hit After I paid $50 for a cartridge What a piece of junk avoid Or suffer the consequences
1330,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月26日,"I ordered my Big Stiiizy from the Stiiizy store on line. I charged it, its the white light, but it doesnt work. I have 2 other regular Stiiiizy batteries and they work find. Any suggestions at all as to what I can do to get this one to work for me."
1331,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月4日,Man I love stiiizy I bought this battery and had it for 26 hours. I had it in my lap didnt see it got out of my car and it fell 2 feet to the ground and it just shattered in to 2 pieces and no longer works for 35 bucks its poorly made.
1332,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年9月5日,Itâs a good battery but you canât consistently hit it without burning the cartridge. Compared to the small battery the big battery doesnât really work like you think it would. honestly the small battery allowed me to hit my cartridge consistently without burning the cart.
1333,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月27日,what do you expect from a bad company haha
1334,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年8月11日,bring the Biiig batteries to VEGAS!! they aren't available in Nevada at all
1335,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,Great experience with Cody behind the counter. Knowledgeable quick and efficient. Would come back for sure!
1336,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月12日,"The security here is wild. Be prepared to be scrutinized and strip off all your bags, and anything that you wouldn't let an obvious criminal have. I'm surprised I didn't have to take my shoelaces out.Back in the day the mission used to be the place to go to find a dispensary. Now if you can go anywhere else, avoid the Mission if you can, and that counts for this place."
1337,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月17日,"I'm honestly super bummed - I loved coming here! like I've literally come here since it's been open, spent probably thousands of dollars, and my experience today made me not want to come back. This was the first time I ever received a faulty cart from stiiizy. I bought a stiiizy pod and had it for maybe a day, hit it TWICE, and was left with resin burning my lips  and spewing out of the top of the cart (actually something I researched saying that it means it's a faulty cart). I obviously didn't want to hit it anymore and they always say if something is wrong you have 7 days to come back and they will replace it. I waited 2 days & bring the pod back into stiiizy for someone to check it out and Jeff the manager said because it wasn't 1/2 way full there's no way to replace it. I didn't understand that bc I tried to explain to him that the pod was literally leaking into the into my stiiizy battery (pictures attached) and there was no way I could have hit it because it was leaking from both end, and how would the pod have still had more than 1/2 it's content when it was leaking... They didn't replace nor discount my next pod. Anyone experience this?"
1338,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月3日,I met Julian on Monday at l y t t in Pacifica. He did a father's job representing this company he has wonderful people's clothes I recommend everyone to go there I was truly delighted. With his outstanding yes please his people style.
1339,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月23日,"ILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!Terrible customer service. I went to pick up indica flower, the cashier gave me 3 options of indica and I picked the one with the highest THC which was 31%. I trusted that they gave me indica because that's what I asked for and thats what was repeated back to me. After I got the weed, I went to run an errand & once I got home to roll up. I seen that on the package it said ""HYBRID"". I don't smoke hybrid. Indica only. I didn't open the package, they also sent the receipt to my email so I didn't check it until I was getting ready to take the package back. I go back to the store to basically switch to a different one, not return but just switch it out. The person at the front desk told me they don't accept returns. The manager also came to me and told me that he doesn't do returns. I'm not understanding why you can't let me switch it out when I'm a loyal customer and come here often. The package was no where near open. What type of shit is that? Definitely won't be coming here ever again."
1340,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月5日,"Only thing I hate is I always get there right when the doors are closing at 945, but everyone working there is always extremely helpful"
1341,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月27日,"This place = great experience!!Wow! I walked out of here with a steal! They hit me so many times with great deals. The day I went, flower was 20% off, and first time customers receive 10% offOliver helped me make the best purchase. Ended up with biscotti and bday cake pods, cookies PR, and the bIIItes (which aren't in NV yet and they need to be!!!!) we fell in love with the stiiizy biiites!So anyways I got all of that for around $86 after tax. My jaw dropped too. Stiiizy on Mission has my business every time I come back to SF now. Place is super clean and also only one person allowed at a time due to covid restrictions."
1342,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月28日,I bought my stizzy probably a year or two ago and I loved going from cartridges to pods. But In the last month or two EVERY single pod I've bought leaks into my battery. It doesn't matter where I get it from either. Really upsetting that the quality has gone completely downhill
1343,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月21日,"BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE YELLED AT. THIS PLACE WILL KILL YOUR VIBE. I totally understand that businesses have different protocols for COVID, but this place makes you feel uncomfortable. The first time I came here a short-haired tatted budtender helped me and she was rude af. You would think workers at a dispensary would be chill, NOT HERE.  Every other dispensary I have ever been to have had nice workers. So here was my experience today...I arrived with my sister (my sister who I live with), and we got our temperature taken. Cool. Next we checked in and the lady at the front said we had to stay six feet apart but get helped by the same budtender. Like I said, businesses can have whatever COVID protocols, but theirs is a little offputting. I was helped by a man that was cool, then my sister decided she didn't want to get anything. She walked up to me and a different worker said we couldn't be next to each other. My sister kindly said ""okay, I just wanted to accompany my sister"", and he rudely said ""WELL THEN YOU GOTTA GO OUTSIDE"". There must be poor management because these workers are WHACK. Save your time and money and go to any other dispensary. It's also cash only... why? It's 2020 and it's more common for dispensaries to take card now. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying cash if the workers weren't so cold here.The dispensary around the corner looks way more welcoming. I actually tried going there but they were closing and recommended going to this trash place because they opened later. They should just tell people to come back when they're open because STIIIZY is horrible."
1344,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月20日,Lotta hella fine selections here at Stiiizy! This place is off the hook! Couldn't even find some of their dank in other dispensaries! I'mma be coming here more in the future to check out what latest dank they got!
1345,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月8日,"Went in for some things and waiting in line for 15 minutes or so , and bro with the fucked up flat top decided to wait till I was ready to pay to say he can't cash anyone out after 10pm, if this is the manager of the store I feel for them, big fuck you to you"
1346,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月2日,Defective pods and terrible customer service. The very first vape pod I purchased with them was defective. I had to return today but did not have my original packaging so they denied any exchange or refund. Apparently this happens a lot. So many other places you can go. Skip this one.
1347,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月3日,"Damn you guys are so rude. They rushed me to buy my shit (the guy with a full face covering and head thing on?) He was a rude little guy. Anyway I bought the weed I seen printed online for 16% on Riverview farms website.. when I stepped out that dispensary that shit said 8%. (Mind you I didn't check the percentage because I was sure it would be 16%) as it stated online.. I went back inside to ask for a switch of another strain because I didn't even open it yet smh.. he told me ""I cant exchange flower blah blah blah.. the new girl doesn't know what she's talking about in the front so yeah."" What? Bruh. $40 wasted. Was also trying not to make a scene because I have $33 to my name I'm stressed enough.Please stop hiring rude men who can't even greet you when you walk up to the counter.. I cant even get high on a mf Friday night. I think ima stick to buying weed somewhere else. Bleh"
1348,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月4日,"2 things here.1 Customer Service: This place has one really bad apple.  I love the staff here and they are very warm and welcoming but this one woman which is probably hispanic and is a little heavier ( I do not like to make labels, I just don't know her name and would like to describe her) She is completely RUDE.  From checking in clients to helping them pick flavors she is really rude with a super attitude.I honestly get uncomfortable every-time she helps me because she is NOT helpful and stays having a dirty look on her face.  You can tell she doesn't want to be there and literally give no effort.  I will literally let someone cut me inline so she's not the one taking care of me, because I know she wont. When I asked for something on the lower end she gave me this look that just rubbed me the wrong way and It has just stuck with me since. If I'm feeling like this I am sure others are as well.  And I feel bad for the rest of the amazing staff that has to share tips with her because she for sure isn't putting in work like the rest of them.2 Flower quality: For the most part the flower is good.  But I got a bag a while ago that was the absolute worst thing ive ever got from a club. They should not be selling anything like this, taste, smell, gross.  the weed tasted like it was either cut to early or had some kind of chemical burn. Just Nasty, and then they call it ""Blue Cookies"" or somthing thinking you're going to get that.  mmmmmmmmm Nope!  No club should be able to sell this garbage. waste to money. Picture below and beware."
1349,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月8日,Piece of shit scammers they sell half grams and say they are full grams this is a scam and company they deserve a zero everybody must know about this they sell half grams and charge you for a full gram they are completely scamming their customers this is complete bullshit
1350,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月21日,"Normally, I would've been surprised to find out Stiiizy has such a low rating. But after finding out they are a franchised business it makes sense to see the rating be so low. 1! First and foremost this, location did away with the one thing that made them super legit and always had me walking through the door. My military discount. Wow! Not just that but all discounts.2nd. The rude and horrible customer service that I received from the girl that must've thought that she was too cute to read off some hand written tags. It's not my fault her leg was hurting and she's working an unorganized sales floor that has the Stiiizy pod products in 2 different sections instead of having, ""two sections."" I'm spending over $200, forgive me for wanting to know my options! Get a better set-up!I really wish dispensaries would stop hiring these ""so-called"" cute girls thinking they'll sell more and in actuality they end up having horrible customer service because they actually have to work. And it's not just standing there looking cute getting tips. And then they get hit on so much, they end up thinking every guy is going to hit on them and their customer service lacks.But then the very few real people and ""guys"" who are actually knowledgeable and willing to work, end up having a hard time getting those jobs, that they would actually benefit the business... Due to hiring half-assed wannabes."
1351,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月10日,"Had gone to this location a couple of times specifically for disposable vape pens. The customer service on my first experience was sub- par, they assume that you know how their system works and how the store is organized, nobody seems enthusiastic to help. Yesterday I went to return a faulty disposable battery and with about half of the pod left in they claimed it stopped working because I was out of wax. There was clearly plenty of oil left in the cartridge and it seemed to be a problem with the battery. They told me tough luck and sent me on my way. Definitely the last time I will support that store and NEVER buy any stiizy products anywhere else. This company needs to be ran more professional and train their staff on customer service and product knowledge. Very disappointed"
1352,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月18日,"******WARNING!!!!!!****IF YOU WISH TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS!!!!If I could I'd give a negative star. Their service doesn't even equate to zero because the way the treat you will have you feeling attacked and violated.They disrespectfully kicked me out for wanting to have a conversation with my own biological sister whom I was with in the store."
1353,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月10日,"If you close at 9:50 update your hours online (weedmaps, leafly, etc).Even the Yelp page has 10:00 but under it there's a note that says 9:50. Which is it? Get your house in order. Update your hours or, you know, stay open til you say you will.And if you're not gonna bother, at the very least at least pretend to care that a patient rushed to your establishment instead of shooing them away like pests when they arrive. Is this one of those places where people go to get disrespected? Maybe that flies in LA, but it doesn't in most places. And by looking at other reviews it looks like they have a culture problem they are either unwilling or unable to address."
1354,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月17日,Was at the Stiiizy Mission St. location last night and bought a honey leaf OG Kush cartridge that was defective but did not know it until I discarded the receipt and packaging in a dumpster. The SORRY ASS MANAGER would exchange my cartridge without the package that it came in. Their weed is for shit and they sell defective Vape cartridges. Once in a while they'll have a strain of weed that's good but other than that if you want quality stay away from this location.
1355,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月6日,"I just went into this dispensary for the first time. My boyfriend usually buys me gummies for me to help sleep at night. ANYWAYS, I figured I'd go with him to check it out, considering I've never been here. Yes, this place was compliant with all the COVID protocol's, which I can appreciate bc my daughter is high risk. We are standing in line on the same sticker six feet from the other people in line. Out of no where this guy yells across the counter, hella loud at me to stay 6ft apart from by bf. ??? Ok. I get it. So my bf moves up first, I stay where I'm at. It becomes my bfs turn to go up to the counter, so I follow him..  because 1. I've never been here, idk how this works 2. We are together 3. Ultimately we are paying together. 4. My bf was going to point out the gummies I've tried vs ones I liked etc.... Then I get semi yelled at again and was told to ""get back!!""..... ???? Wtf?  I said, ""it's ok then, I'll just wait outside.. what's the point?"" I wanted to take a look at stuff with my bf just bc he's the one that knows what I'm looking for. But anyway, I figured he can grab it like he normally does. So I go stand outside, some creepy ass dudes driving by honking and whistling at me. I go peak inside to see if my bf is wrapping up and paying.. and I see there's a guy who WE DID NOT COME WITH all up on my bfs back,  looking at the same shit my bf is (not even 6 inches apart) but yet I couldn't stand next to him to take look? Makes no sense. Also, I'd like to add, they didn't even grab the right wax he wanted, but he was too nice to go in and complain. Yes, I'm sure whoever was working could've helped me, but being called out by this person 2 times in a line of 5-6 people (all guys, mind you) definitely didn't make me feel comfortable wanting any customer service from them. Maybe they should spread their product out more... And have the line completely outside.. in case people want to go in with someone. I can't be the ONLY person, that wanted to stand next to their significant other while picking out their product(s) ((WHOM THEY LIVE WITH. ))Also, If you're going to call out a customer (in front of people) maybe you should have a staff member walk up to them and explain the situation (so what.. each of us would take a turn to pick shit out, and my bf would come back and pay?). Or have security explain how it's being done with COVID. Security, and the front desk lady knew it was my first time, but yet no one explained how anything worked. Just overall unprofessional."
1356,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月22日,I've been coming here for a while now. I always have a good experience with these guys. Some bud tenders might be more chill than others but overall everyone is really nice. Regardless of other peoples own negative experiences I'd still recommend these guys. Prices are legit and they have almost everything you want.
1357,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月2日,"This club is a joke, they gave all these discounts just to get people to come in so they didn't close during covid, just to take them away DURING COVID . Also it's not like it's poppin the lines are long because the bud tenders are slow and and it seems like there are 10 people working behind the booth when really their talking about nothing and 1 or 2 people are working , I will not  be coming back , everyone to Urbana around the corner, they take card and delivery. This club can go back to Southern California to be honest"
1358,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,I give this place another shot because my little sister wanted to try plus she just turned 22 so it's all good. Thank you so much Jason for all your help. You helped me my 1st time there and I so happy you helped my lil sis this time. You're so awesome. Love the way you were very patient with her and all the information you gave her. Thank you so very much.
1359,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月13日,"Bummer. Service here has gone downhill since they changed from LaCorona. Stopped carrying the Lowell farms I liked or the dog walkers in the tiny tins. Front desk attendant had to shout instructions at me over their loud music. Maybe turn it down? Now cash only. They make you use this silly atm up front. Husband and I went in for a couple things and even though we arrived together, weren't allowed to stand near each other the required 6 feet from the counter and look at the menu. Budtenders kept shouting at us to separate. I used to stop by here often, but I won't be back."
1360,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月11日,"Had a pretty terrible experience at this dispensary. I went in looking for a pax pod (yeah my bad), and when I was buying it I asked the person helping me twice if the pod would work with pax. He said yes twice. I walked out the door and realized that the label didn't say pax at all. When I went back in, I told them my situation and they had me stand back in line and the manager told me that they couldn't return it or refund it at all. She said that the package looked opened, even though I had just left the store. It was extremely frustrating because I don't own a stiizy battery, and they were unwilling to do anything about it even though their employee had confirmed with me that the pod was compatible with pax when they aren't. I will not be coming back here. Highly recommend purple star instead - better prices and better service."
1361,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月16日,I've been a customer for many months.I've always been treated with respect by the staff and managers. Luis helped me out today and he was great.
1362,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月21日,"I love Stiiizy products, but this store location doesn't have the best customer service. And they never have any deals going on like every other dispensary I've been to. What's up with that? I do think those sealed baggies they put your items in are nice though. For whatever that's worth..."
1363,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月19日,"Looking at other reviews I guess I'm not the only one who's dealt with a rude sales girl who loves to give attitude and yell at customers. Came here with my dude and although we were buying separately we were standing next to each other and the crazy chick up front starts screaming at us to be six feet apart. Like ma'am, we literally live in the same household so how does it make sense for us to be six feet apart? Even if it is the store policy there's absolutely no reason to act all crazy about it. Anyway this place has hella bad vibes, don't recommend."
1364,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月29日,I love coming to this location! I just went about 2 days ago and the Budtender Gems was killin it recommending so many options when I was getting overwhelmed with all the flavors. They told me to try to the CDT Pods and I recommended White Truffle and it's now my new favorite flavor! Gotta come back some more!
1365,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月11日,Went in today wanting to buy some products. Wanted to support a local business. Needed to buy my months worth of supplies. It was so loud I could not hear the employee behind the counter; they proceeded to pull their mask away from their face and continued to talk at me. I told her I needed a minute; and they continued to talk AT me. Please let a person look and ask the questions. I was hounded so much I left and went to another shop.  The security guard and reception were very nice. The sales employee was too aggressive.
1366,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月31日,Really loved the experience. The receptionist had a great personality and made my first dispensary experience as smooth as possible. The guys working in the back knew exactly what I needed based off what I was looking for and the product definitely met those expectations. Really great place and will be returning for future re-ups.
1367,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月21日,"Catherine has to be the best and most bubbly receptionist I have ever met!!!! You guys need to make her a budtender, 10/10 I'll deffffff be coming back"
1368,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月20日,Everyone is friendly here. They have social distancing tapes on the ground and rules to follow. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. It's a clean establishment. It's cash only. They have a ton of selection. Parking is metered and not too terrible.
1369,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月30日,"This shop is awesome!! I go here a couple of times a week because they've got the best prices around. I purchase my Heavy Hitters cartridges and all my flower here, esp on Thur and Fri because they have flower deals on those days. I live close by near the Mission District and their location is only 7 mins away from my home. Everyone from the security to the front desk staff and budtenders are uber welcoming and professional."
1370,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月25日,"What a joke. It clearly says online that they're open until 10pm daily. I showed up at 9:44pm And they turned me away stating that they ""close in 5 minutes"", Pointing to a sign on the door that says ""10 AM to 9:50 PM daily"". I showed them the current time on my phone and the time listed online, apparently they don't like being proven wrong because the guy shut the door in my face. I'll definitely be going around the corner to Urbana from now on. I normally do since it's a way better business and has friendlier staff, but they close at 9 PM and I couldn't make it in time."
1371,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月7日,"Always a lit time with Alycia! If she's there definitely go to her, she treats me like family. Literally! 5/5 stars for this place. Definitely gonna come back here."
1372,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月16日,Good shit they have the best bud and prices in Bay Area. And the best part is that all the tax is included in the price you see
1373,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月2日,"I've been here a few times because it's convenient and chill, but today I had an experience that turned me into a forever loyal customer!I had an issue with a broken vape cartridge I purchased, and it turned out to be incompatible with my battery module. Even though they were super busy while I was there, Issy (the manager) did some in-depth research for me to determine the type of cartridge I should get in the future, and helped me find a battery that would work with the products I have currently. She truly went above and beyond to help me. This place rocks and I will definitely be making this my home store!!"
1374,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月22日,Always a go to spot in The Mission. The staff is very friendly and always directs me to what I am looking for. The Stiiizy staff is the best.
1375,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月26日,"As a ""tourist"" I visited this location and my ID was scanned in ( I'm from Out of state) Spent a good amount of money. Note my DL had a piece of tape on it from being cracked, not broken. I flew across the country and this same ID was accepted via TSA. Returned to make an additional purchase 2 days later and was turned away because of that same little piece of tape. Now mind you, my ID was ""scanned in"" at my first visit and my ID was valid when I spent money but then not today? It's cool tho... I will spend my money else where. Cannabis is legal where I'm from so you're Not doing me any favors, and Out of principle I will not be purchasing from your chain and  no one I know will be neither. Girl at the front counter ( little nerdy with glasses,but cute) is rude as shit and pulls the ""state compliance"" card and refuses to listen... rude and just talks over you like you've done something wrong. Bad for business attitude for sure."
1376,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月13日,The receptionist cat really made my day when I walked in she helped me get in and out by giving  me helpful tips like the daily deals for the day and the st pattys deal couldn't ask for better Customer service !
1377,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月24日,"It's impossible to list why I'm so upset. This used to be a great place. I was told some time ago that they were undergoing a remodel. This is on a whole different level, something else. It was a take over from a massive company. All the neighborhood charm, all the local flavor, and any deals that helps retain people and welcome people from the neighborhood back as if they were just family members...gone. So is my business.Robert, the security guard was the only familiar face to greet me when I returned after the 'remodel'. After I checked in, they scanned my ID again scanned my rec again and welcomed me in with a 10% first time visitor discount as if I'd never been there.I found that extraordinarily insulting. Especially since they asked if it was my first time back since the 'remodel'. After they found out I was a regular, they still treated me like it was my first time into not just that facility but any cannabis dispensary. They can keep my 10% I just want my old place back. I might just have to go back to buying illegally. At least those dealers know you. Wipe this place off your map because they are no longer La Corona. Not in name, not in staff, not in atmosphere, not in practice, not in neighborhood, not in anything. It doesn't even fit The Mission which was the whole mission of La Corona in the first place. I remember a local hardware store in my hometown sold out to a major company. All the old staff that had been there for 30 years and kept that place running left because of how management treated them afterward. They closed a year later because all the local business keeping it afloat stopped using it. I hope that happens to this new place."
1378,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月14日,"I wish the budtenders didn't make me feel like I was wasting their time and that they at least ACTED Like they were in the business of customer service instead of just tolerating my questions about products. I'll be avoiding this place after that experience just now. Especially, as a female, ya'lls MALE employees should treat female customers better."
1379,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月31日,"I love coming here, prices are just right, the people are awesome and well where else can a bunch of ladies start dancing to BBD's Poison on a Friday afternoon? :)"
1380,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月1日,"NO CAP I came in like the very last minute I could. I felt bad but Stiiizy is always on point. The staff is always friendly and I love the energy they radiate. Tonight Ernesto helped me get in and out and made sure my order was in before 10. After that they can no longer take orders or accept payment. Even though I came in with 5 left to spare, I didn't feel rushed and the service was great! Thank you Ernesto!"
1381,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月27日,Stiiizy think they slick . Smh San Francisco put the no tax on the price of weed because people didn't want to pay 60 plus for an 8th and went to the streets. So now Stiiizy already put the tax on the weed price . So the 8th still 60 plus . Y'all funny but it's capitalism at its finest.
1382,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月5日,You can't look at the weed before you buy it. The staff are uneducated on the product. The staff is aggressive. You would think people selling weed would be laid back and chill but it's like they are all angry. The Davis location is further and smaller but there is much better service and the staff can actually talk about the product AND they let you see your weed before you purchase it.
1383,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月30日,"Overpriced.  The place aesthetically is great but too bougie for my taste.  The weed is subpar, so you're paying for the expensive visual experience.  The cashiers have very little knowledge of the products and strands.  Great if you want to take a pic for Instagram, not if you want some good cannabis products."
1384,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月30日,I was visiting from Seattle I've never been to a cannabis club in California before. I was not aware of the brands of cannabis in California and this club but Sofiea helped me to get familiar with products at this club. I left with exactly what I wanted.
1385,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月7日,Cool prices but the staff is hella weak and don't care. Just had to walk out cause I was waiting to be checked out but they were taking more customers in to where no one could ring me up. Thanks for the effort won't be coming back here again
1386,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月1日,Very bad experience All the time when I asked for product the said out the store and the give me bad products I will never  go there
1387,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月6日,"These guys have the best love rosin badder and other dab/pods. Joe. S. Hooked me up, he had to dig for the one I wanted. Cherry pie live rosin badder"
1388,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月31日,"LOVE THIS STORE. Love the daily deals, love the vibes! Tee and Liz are the best and I can't wait to shop WAX WEDNESDAY!! Best in class service here every single time !!"
1389,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月15日,Pretty sure the I's in STIIIZY stand for impossibly inept imbeciles. If you're gonna shut the door on medical patients' face because it's 9:49pm then don't have your hours as 10pm. Came here from pretty far away because their prices were better and it was the only time we could but every time they're just rude as hell. The budtenders obviously know a lot but god forbid you ask them any questions. Not to mention one of them took my friends information from her account to incessantly text her then got all pissed off when she said she wasn't interested. Dawg you really out here being the worst to customers and then make them too uncomfortable to come back but whatever y'all make your coin harassing people. If you made it to the end of this review then you might as well drive down the block to Greenthumbs.
1390,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月14日,"Reason is that they do not support black people , even the ones that work for them . The Bay Area supports black people but stiizy employs blacks just so they won't get backlash but they treat their black employees and Latin employees like trash . Yes they will find few blacks to say they been treated well but I know for sure they don't , from San Francisco area to concord area all the way down to alameda county . I can tell you about their employees getting treated unfair and customers and contracted employees also . That's why they don't be getting sales like that also cause of how they treat their own staff and customers . How you in the business but don't know customers or what's actually legal for them to do . Anybody need factual information on how they are treating employees or customers , we will be having reviews and discussion on a platform coming soon , and we actually didn't want to do it like this but something has to change big weed companies don't care about their customers or employees. I wonder how the board will feel about this information of this club operating the way they do . Culture vultures , I should actually start posting the videos of customers and they way we treated as customers"
1391,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月12日,Solid spot to scoop all the delicious flowers and concentrates. Clean location with all the proper protocol. Appreciate the hospitality and recommendation from Dennis.
1392,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月8日,"Charged different prices for same product last 3 times , on same day ,with same daily deal bad customer service 4 out of the 5 times I've been.The product is great ,the attitude and the getting lied to about pricing is enough to buy from another source."
1393,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月30日,"I love this cannabis shop. I come here a few times before I have to go back home. Everyone's nice and loves to explain to me in detail, on what I'm buying :) friendly peeps. Would def recommend to my friends who go to cannabis shops!"
1394,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月18日,"WOW!!! Front desk guy was MAD Rude to me!!! I came in all chipper and polite, dispute the fact I may Be another industry person he sees 20th time that same day, But his customer service skills lack! He mocked me for coming in, straight up fake typed and was like ""I will get on it and let someone know. Your only the 100th vendor that came in!"" He didn't even give me a chance to even set myself apart. He just tore me apart. Then chewed up a menu he asked me to leave. If this is what the brand is about.... being haters and judging people at the front door, I want no part of it. Any Customers who seek compassion or friendly service, It's not at that shop. If your a little hype beast, and love to troll around. Then this is your shop!"
1395,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月6日,First time customer of Stiizy. They sold me expired Kanha Cannabis Infused Gummies. The tenders was brusk and had limited knowledge of the products they were selling. I will be contacting the Office of Cannabis to submit a formal complaint.
1396,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月7日,"This place kinda blows now that they remodeled and changed to stiizy. The people are still friendly and the door guy is the same thankfully (he's dope) but this place is coming off hella corporate now. But the product was more expensive for the same stuff and they CHARGE 3 DOLLARS to use your damn card now! The ONLY good change I noticed was that if you're a sf resident you get a 5-10% discount or something like that. Other than that, this place isn't worth it anymore."
1397,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月8日,"This rating is for Jasmine! I called in to ask about apparel and she was polite, fast and efficient. Thank you for your help!"
1398,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月16日,"check the date! check the date! check the date! this place is known for having great deals for moldy, old and expired products. even the $80 flower is way beyond old!! ask for the date before you buy anything because they will not do a return or refund. i know"
1399,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月2日,I dropped by for the Grand Opening. The staff was friendly enough however everything is behind glass with no prices listed. The items I asked about were not in stock even though they were on display. The clerk helping me did not know the products. On top of everything else they had a tip jar out! That is like going to Walgreens and having to tip your clerk.  If they can't pay the staff enough nor educate them I don't want to shop here.
1400,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月18日,"be careful what you buy here!!! i made the wrong decision to make a store pickup order through weedmaps. there menu says live but that may be a lie! i purchased a 8th here for what there ""live"" menu said was quite fresh and high on thc. what i received was completely the opposite. the 8th was very low on thc, it was close to expiring and the 8th looked extremely wrinkled and crushed the manager said the false misleading advertisement of the product was not there fault but weedmaps. however upon speaking to customer service it was clearly stiiizys fault on misleading consumers on purchasing false  authenticity and quality of a product then refusing to take ownership when there receipt even says otherwise. if thats not close to stealing i don't know what is. the manager could of easily deemed it defective but at every turn chose not to take responsibility. Out of all my years and all the clubs I have ever been to this was the first time a dispensary FAILED to take responsibility for there wrong doing. pretty shady moves by such an establishment.---- DONT COME HERE, they sell EXPIRED weed then won't refund you AT ALL even though the moldy weed is potentially hazardous for anyone with stomach issues. --- GO TO *PURPLE STAR*----- or ----Mission Organic---"
1401,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月16日,"STIIIZY replaced la corona wellness in the south mission. It has really renovated the space making it visually appealing. Clean lines, bright lights, attention to detail make this store feel like a great modern shopping experience. Everyone I have interacted with is so friendly and helpful. Yea, it skews to STIIIZY branded products but they also have a lot of other products that will keep you satisfied. Also gotta say I got the STIIIZY pod system and like it much better than pax. The toke are smoother, taste is better and the cartridges seem to last longer. Overall would recommend."
1402,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月27日,Awesome place and staff. Just moved up to this area from San Jose and am so glad to stumble down here. Girl at the front desk was super friendly and great. The guy helping me helped me find good choices that I don't regret. Definitely coming back here.
1403,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月2日,Chris had the worst customer service. Very rude and not helpful. Made me not want to come back here. First time here and was a bad experience.
1404,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月23日,"This place is awesome!!! They have super nice employees that help you out with any questions you have. Also, I've saved so much money because they always have deals! The gummies they have are my absolute favorite"
1405,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月22日,"Lost my battery and happened to be in the Mission, walked in and was assisted by Francis-- sold on live  resin Ice Cream Cake, Bloom Disposable pen Maui Waui . excellent service. Thank You!"
1406,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月11日,I was walking home from work the other day and I noticed a big poster inside this place where a African-American man is smoking a marijuana joint. This is another example of black exploitation. Whoever owns this place should be ashamed.This place should definitely be boycotted by civil rights advocates.
1407,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月14日,"What's up with buying a $40 joint SMALLER THAN MY PINKY and when you light it up the thing it's just ashes no smoke. Went back into the store since I am not a new costumer nor smoker, just for them to escort me out on v-day... when this happens the manager should've checked it and offer a replace instead of arguing with the costumer saying it was halfway...what part of all ashes no smoke did he not understand..oh and on my way out there was someone else complaining that his stuff wasn't good either DEFINITELY NOT RETURNING"
1408,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月1日,One of my favorite new clubs in San Fran. I can't in there first time a few days ago and had to come back because the quality was amazing and the staff was very friendly! Come in for great quality and friendly service!
1409,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月4日,Solid prices. Solid first-timer discount. Solid knowledge and service. Left with great recommendations and stuff that is every bit as great as advertised. Welcome to the hood!
1410,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月8日,"Awful company. Particularly awful store. Went in for the first time, asked for a vape cartridge. Budtender offers bla bla bla. It's weed so I don't really care. I say sure. Product is not viewable because of their packaging. I walk out of store, open packaging. Vape cartridge does not fit on my battery. I have that circular/cylindrical battery that is by far the most common. Like the one everyone has. I didn't even know there was another type. Apparently there is. Budtender knew they offer 2 types but didn't have a thought to maybe clarify which of the 2 types I needed. He just presumed to know. I turn back into the store. Bare in mind that I had left the store 30 seconds prior. Manager is argumentative in that passive aggressive sorta way where they're making it like I'm the one being difficult. It's beyond absurd. They tell me absolutely no returns/exchanges. The product is mine now but they'll happily sell me a second cartridge. They tell me to phone customer service. The number they provide does not lead you to anyone. They rip me off for $35 because of their own mistake. Could have had a customer for years.  Whatever."
1411,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月20日,S/O to Izzy @ Stiiizy. I really appreciate how patient she was with my indecisiveness!!
1412,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月29日,"Today I walked in and was very displeased with the way my orders were taken care of. Female worker was too high on the job and just wasn't on the same planet I was. I let her know about the mistake she made and that I wanted a full gram carts, ended up getting half grams and it seemed like all she could do is laugh about the fact that she made a mistake. I came back in trying to fix my issue which was to get my order right, but solely based off the employees mistakes no matter what, I was told by managers ""Sales are final"". Even if the employees lack of attentiveness was the reason why my order was MESSED UP!! They say thats POLICY..."
1413,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月20日,Staff are not there to make your experience better they only want to sell you weed i would recommend barbery coast in sf there is two locations both are excellent
1414,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月18日,"Sophia was amazing!!!! great customer service, friendly store, top notch weed, highly recommend"
1415,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月1日,I Love this Dispensary! I've been coming here for a few years now (before the Grand Opening) & I'm very pleased with the new set-up. The staff is hella friendly & very knowledgeable. They have fire flowers & lots of other great products. I really appreciate the the staff's patience especially when its so hard to choose from everything they have. I would recommend anyone here. Especially if you suffer from any medical conditions. There is so many CBD products to choose from.
1416,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,"the staff was super welcoming, we took forever but the home girl Sabrina really took care of us and took the time to actually look through their stock to make sure we left with some that zaaa"
1417,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月24日,"First of i never been here right but was told they get pretty packed  but I literally jus called and a man named Gabriel picked up and i said "" hello how are you just wanted to asm if you guy's were busy at the moment and he was speaking with another customer at the moment then i said ""hello?"" and he said your good togo to the other customer but gave me hella attitude and said ""i said yes we're busy"" but with a stank ass attitude.  Never been in AND NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TOGO IN THANKS GABRIEL YOU RUDE AHH"
1418,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月16日,One of my favorite dispensaries in the city. Good music and very friendly staff. Especially Joseph! Always provides 5 star service and has great recommendations for tree. Will return!
1419,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月15日,"bud tenders just want to upsell you to make commission. not thorough about products , i felt very rushed from the counter . dont go to this stiizy location , they will kill your vibe, rob your pockets and laugh about it !!"
1420,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月29日,"First time I went I was so disappointed by the dry weed I bought. The second time i mentioned this and one of the staff grabbed two bags and said ""this is what dry weed sounds and feels like, this is what fresh weed feels like. I won't do that to you."" And I got some fire weed and I thank you! The 3rd time today I asked dude with the fluffy hair if he had anything good and not to high priced and BAM. 36$ eight or some stupid fire CRUs Pure Kush. My man! This is my club now!"
1421,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月14日,"I went in for the first time last night excited to see what they were about. I had already knew what I wanted to purchase after looking on Weedmaps, to make things easier. Although it stated they updated their inventory within 3 minutes of looking, when I had got to the counter the budtender (who had a good attitude) sadly had NO KNOWLEDGE of the merchandise. She stated that the item I wanted was sold out after not knowing where to look. When I asked her to show me a similar option it was like asking as car salesman to show me a house! They had a special promotion for new members. When I asked about that deal for the day she continued to not be ANY assistance. Beyond annoyed that Urbana (my go to was already closed) I went down the way to Dr Greenthumb who is always hassle free. I'm sad writing this review! As much as I thought I'd love the place when I walked in, I left quicker than I waited in line. Either train your staff with product classes or get new people in there all together!!!!!!"
1422,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月3日,"Dennis gave great customer service, and he is very friendly and social as well gave me great recommendation."
1423,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月18日,"Great Weed Club , Richie helped me out ! He's very knowledgeable and great conversation"
1424,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月4日,"I've been here maybe a handful of times mostly for daily deals and the close proximity to my house, as I usually go to Purple Star and used to frequent Dr Greenthumb when it was cookies. Anyways I decided to jump on stiiizy board and treated myself to 2 half g pods and a rose battery for $60 (each was $20..normally $25). Figured can't beat that price as $25/20 per half gram pod! I have enjoyed them but I have recently got a Dart battery (480mAh) which blows the stiiizy(210mAh) out of the water...I think its got closer mAh to the biiig stiiizy battery? Anyways as for the actual location its great as theres usually decent street parking and you can usually get away with parking in safeway lot for a bit. The security and receptionists have always been friendly and have zero complaints about! The budtenders have been pretty good but the last time I was there I was overcharged. Hopefully I can get the rest of my change back even though it's been a little while since, but I bought 1 half gram pod on a Sunday when they are supposed to be 20% off and for some reason I ended up only getting 5% off?? I had a new trainee BT who was being trained by another BT so there were 2 of them but the newbie rung me up and idk how the BT okayed the price and everything. I'm extremely shy and have really bad social anxiety and if I feel the least bit intimidated I tend to have trouble speaking up for myself. Thus I should have but didn't feel comfortable trying to argue the correct price. I'm on an extremely tight budget due to being broke thanks to the useless EDD. I know that's my issue but just trying to explain as I'm not trying to be a complainer just a very meek and socially awkward patient The first time was perfect & BT took the time to explain (w/o asking!) all diff products and listened to what I was looking for so she was able to help me find the perfect flavored hybrid & indica pods! I got Rose battery instead of Rose Gold but that's ok still cute. Location is top notch as the actual store its self is super modern and looks almost too modern and nice.. seems like most newer dispo's are trying to use this clean hi tech modern look which is very professional looking. However there is only one or 2 of the product displays so I never really feel comfortable looking thru all the displays to see what I'd like..which sucks cos I saw a product I've been searching the entire bay area for but it wasn't listed on their menu so I guess I'll have to ask them whenever I go back next. Wish they carried more Dart battery pods because they hit the best out of ANY of the vape pen batteries on the market! Overall the budtenders are the only thing that might use a little more fine tuning however they arent that bad and there is usually SO many of them that it's really hard to give a proper review on them. Overall clean easily accessible location with pretty good selection but the pods are always in and out of stock. Most of the time they are usually out of the specific size and strain pod I want but can usually find a close alternative."
1425,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月6日,"I came in here and bought close to $400 worth of stuff on Friday 2/27. One of the pods was defective but by the time I noticed it I was back in San Jose(where i live). I cane back on Tuesday 3/3 with my defective pod, box, and receipt. As per their policy on weedmaps and their website, I thought I'd be getting a replacement pod but I come in and every bud tender is a straight up clown. Every budtender pretty much said that my pod was mainly gone so they couldn't do anything for me because the manager on shift isn't very helpful and would only honor me with 20% off on my next pod, heres the deal though, its a DEFECTIVE LEAKY pod. Do they know what the definition of a leak is? Its when things accidentally lose and/or emit their contents which in this case is a $60 gram of concentrate. This pod was already missing 25% of its contents when I first got it, it maybe leaked away another 50% of it, I showed them nonstop that their is still some left in their but it just looks messy because I had the pod in my pocket on the hour car ride back to SF. Nobody wanted to hear me out, they obviously don't know their own product or are too lazy to help out a customer that spent almost $400 just a week ago. Special shoutout to Maria, she is terrible person and an even worse employee. Only person in this establishment that deserves any respect is Elizabeth who was the original budtender and manager who helped me out on Friday 2/27, too bad she was out that day when I came back because even a couple budtenders hinted that she probably would have given me a new pod. Anyways, this place sucks, budtenders probably think they're hot stuff cause they work at Stiizy but they're all lazy bums."
1426,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月4日,"I liked it more when it was la corona. It's alright, but cash only and they doNt  post the correct prices."
1427,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月21日,"Love Neka!!! She was so amazing and so sweet. Really got educated on everything. Such an amazing place with even better employees. Neka needs a raise, only coming back because of how awesome she was!"
1428,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月16日,"So I considered giving 2 stars but I decided to keep it REAL as we do in the Bay Area...I personally loved La Corona and referred everyone I knew or came in contact with to them. But STIIZY. The Grand Opening was semi exciting due to my bud tender Shauna's  positive attitude and knowledge of both the old and new product but after that things went completely down hill. The dispensery is way too bright...the deals are gone...and its way too loud in there, on top of the fact that at least 3 to 4 people scream out welcome to STIIZY & stay STIIZY every time you walk in. It's redundant and annoying ..Maybe LA residents appreciate that but the Bay DOES NOT. There aren't any prices on any of there products so you have to wait for someone to tell you which can be very time consuming...needless to say I haven't been bk since the Grand Opening"
1429,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月16日,"Good customer service and great quality products, not to bad of a wait in the line, and their efficient every time"
1430,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月6日,"i found Stiiizy on Weedmaps earlier this week when i was planning a busy day and was trying to find a place along my way to pick up some concentrates. I have made two trip here since and i gotta say they have some pretty awesome prices, and huge selection of just about everything. the staff has been very friendly both times ive been in. My only gripe is that the concentrates display is kinda difficult to view and with the heat from that lights in the display case the concentrates start to break down and dont look so attractive, i was looking for a particular consistency but everything in the display was altered and there is no knowing how long they have been sitting with lids off baking on low. also wasnt able to smell them. i decided on the ursa skittles which in the display had a sugar-y consistency but when i got home and open it it was much closer to a diamond sauce. -online menus need work, concentrates are in multiple categories and hard to filter though"
1431,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月10日,"Visiting the area to eat and I accidentally spot this place and I love stiiizy  so I went in just to peek. Place was nice as hell and professional. Dude who took my id shared the same birthday as me which I thought was dope since it's it a birthday you hear to often. They had a new flavor that was blue gummy that I want to try! But they weren't all pushy like some dispensaries. I was on my way back to where I live, and just glanced at the shirts which were nice shirts, and the guy who took my id went and just shot me whichever one I wanted and I thought that was bad ass. I will be back to visit with lots more money, thanks guys for a good first experience."
1432,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月6日,Best place on Mission/30th. Great service and great solid prices. You get what you pay for for sure. Highly recommend being a member here you get a helluva a lot more deals than anywhere else
1433,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月24日,"This is one of the best dispensaries i have ever been too, the workers are really friendly and they have the best pods and also have some dam good weed, its decent pricing and not overpriced one bit, i strongly recommend every one in san francisco that smokes weed to try out Stiiizy"
1434,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月18日,The employees work hard to keep the line moving and seem to always offer great deals. Not to mention it's near by. I would definitely recommend!
1435,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月24日,Super friendly and have a great selection. The prices are really good and they will treat you with then best respect MUST COME!!!!
1436,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月7日,Awsomeeee costumer service! best dispensary I've ever been too  come here all the way from montebello don't matter how far
1437,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月7日,"i have been coming to this location for years now. i have never had a bad experience, the staff is always greeting with a smile and my favorite part is when everyone yells welcome. i've had multiple tenders and everytime i get asked about my day, what are my plans and so forth and it's always great when they're trying to make connections and conversation i have never been to a shop where everything is so nice and clean and the people actually seem like they enjoy their job and the time they spend there. i really hope the great experiences continue. melanie melendez"
1438,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月21日,Best place to get your pods quick. Always professional organize and generally nice. Haven't had a problem with my pod once pretty good weed
1439,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月18日,Great service & kind people. Not to mention always are knowledgable about product. Highly recommend this location for first timers.
1440,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月25日,"Ashley was such a great help, wonderful customer service! I will be back for sure!!"
1441,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月13日,"All the business that I give to this store day after day and they can't even honor their own policy of 7 days return if the item doesn't work...I have my Original receipt and packaging with a battery that didn't last a week, why U don't replace it?STIIIZY YOU Ripped me off...I am a pissed off customer              I WILL NEVER RETURN TO ANY OF THEIR  STORE...TERRIBLE SERVICE!"
1442,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月11日,This is my usual spot that's consistent and reliable! We love dependability :p I went in tonight and Jenny helped me today she was sweet!- Rachel Davalos
1443,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月30日,"Downtown LA STIIIZY is my spot, I am there every 3 to 4 days always for my Skywalker pod. You can never go wrong with that choice! The Bud-tenders are always upbeat and they move fast. I'm a regular, so it's nice to see the same smiling faces:-) and it's nice that they recognize me as well. Dope music while you wait and on a good day there's some real good deals. (Month of July).Gotta check it out your self."
1444,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月28日,"Thank you, Bryan for being so super accommodating and welcoming. Made my second visit to the store very pleasant. Will be coming back for more."
1445,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月2日,"Ordered delivery from here. The driver, Johnathan, was Fantastic. I had initially scheduled for 4-6 drop off window but was asked to stay later at work so called and bumped it to 7:30 or later. I'm just barely leaving work at 6:30 and I get a text saying my driver is arriving in 14 minutes. What?!? I text a response stating I bumped it and got an immediate reply saying not to worry he wouldn't bring it until 7:30 or later. When he arrived he was very friendly. Prices were on par with other dispensaries I use in the Glendale area and cheaper than Amuse. Good selection. Will definitely be ordering from them again in the future."
1446,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月31日,Best dispensary in LA. Definitely recommend to order online . Staff is always great too
1447,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月26日,"All chill to stop at this location !! Always lots of staff the wait is always minimum for the time I always go , those 7 Gs of the black labels  keep it up STIIZY DTLA !!!!"
1448,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月6日,"Stacy is my go-to bud tender. She is dope .She has the best personality and bubbly vibe to go with it.  I love her.  I can come in, let her know what's bothering me, and ask her what might do the trick to alleviate whatever my ache or pain might be. She has suggestions like no other and she is very professional.  She helped me a while back and I have not caught her in recently but I""ll always remember her because she was the one who first helped me, on my first visit... some odd eons ago.Sometimes the parking in here can be tricky.  I have a handicapped placard and sometimes there are spots available for me and sometimes there aren't.  Sometimes the guards in the lot neglect the fact that I'm handicapped and need to be parked closer to the entrance of the store.  I don't appreciate that all too much, esp when all of a sudden I find someone without a placard parking in a handicapped sign but might be doing an online pick up or something, like it excludes them from having to follow the rules. I appreciate the employees here who are always so nice to tell me about the new arrivals, new promotions, etc.  They are typically very kind, although I have come across one bud tender who was not too nice to me.  I didn't catch her name.  I wish I'd been ushered to someone else but well, it's too late for all of that. I appreciate that Stiiizy keeps their word and if you are to buy a cartridge for your pen, or a starter pen, they encourage you to keep your receipt and box and to bring it back if there are any issues.  If in the rare instance that you receive items that you hadn't selected, your opportunity to doubt check your order is when they're rung up and what not. I have been here enough times to see customers not pay attention and then get upset when they leave with items that weren't theirs. You've gotta be a responsible consumer!  I love the variety of their pods/cartridges.  I like to switch mine out constantly.  I have a few favorites now and so those are the ones that I typically buy but it's nice to be easily able to change things up as often as I please. So, you can only imagine how much I love to be able to take advantage of their promos on cartridges, esp when I'm a new customer at a different location."
1449,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月31日,Been buying stiiizy product before they became this big sensation. I enjoyed and was present to their launch debut party and been a customer ever since. I specially have to give a shout-out  to the the staff that's always at reception they are awesome and kind!! Products and flowers are great and the prices are even better!! I love coming here!!  Might even apply to work here haha
1450,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月27日,"I LOVE STIIIZY WITH A PASSION! One of the best if not the best dispensary out here in California. Amazing customer service, employees always treat you with kindness and respect. Always go out of their way to help you out with each purchase. I also love how they handle they're parking situation there is never a time where I have to pull up and I can't find where to park. In Other words you can trust stiiizy with your stoner needs"
1451,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月14日,The process to just get 1 pod is like 30min when u get there u need to wait in that first line then u get access to the 2nd long line to see only 3 cashier open wow really all the money yall making and can't even get more cashier wack!!!!
1452,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月11日,"Best place to pick up and get almost anything you need from pods, edibles, to good old fashion flower. Great daily deals with a positive crew there to greet you and help you out, I definitely recommend coming here."
1453,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月27日,"I love love Stiizy pods, my absolute favorite. I had been to plenty of dispensaries before but never been to the actual stiizy store so when I got the chance I was stoked. The giant warehouse like building was so dope. They had a really nice entrance and once you walk in Hip-op music was playing and the lighting felt like a club. I'm my bud tender was great and I took advantage of a few first time patient deals which I was super happy about. I'll definitely be back asap!"
1454,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月6日,"Deeply disturbed by my first experience here. I realized after paying that Linet P. gave me the wrong pod and I asked another employee for the correct one since Linet kept ringing up other customers and not paying attention to me. That second employee spoke to a third employee who spoke to the manager Peter, and Peter told me that they cannot exchange the incorrect pod for the correct one because ""I already walked out with the pod"" (I hadn't) and that on camera ""it looked like I agreed that it was the correct item"" (I hadn't). I asked to see the footage of this interaction and he said that I am not allowed to see their cameras. He kept pushing for me to keep the incorrect one and also buy the correct one. He then lied saying he spoke to Linet, claiming she told him I agreed that I was given the correct pod. I never saw him speak to Linet. While Peter kept holding up the bag with the incorrect item trying to get me to take it, I told him a couple times that I didn't want it and he told him that they can't keep it in the store either, and I just stood there in shock for a while. I also can't believe Linet wouldn't just own up to her mistake and admit that I wanted a different one."
1455,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月3日,"First timer and security and staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. The ambience and atmosphere are like stepping into a portal of a very cool Californian Star Wars scene with otherworldly strains of cannabis. Great first impression! Christian really provided top tier customer service!"
1456,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月14日,"Coming here for a while, service is always 100%, product is always 100%. Finally used my credit which lowered the value of a pod. Which is cool that this is offered since things do add up. Will continue to come back!!"
1457,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月11日,My experience at STIIIZY DTLA has always been good. From the easy check in process to the quality of products.
1458,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月26日,"Been coming to stiiizy for over 4 years! Hell i even went to their hubble studios x stiiizy launch party! Amazing flower,from top shelf to mids! Everything for everyone! I always get treated like family! Also the retna artwork is INSANE!   Come by on your next dispo run!"
1459,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月7日,"My favorite shop! I make the drive from Downey. Great price, great product, great staff. Love the way it looks when you come in to the place. I mostly order online and just pick up. Depending on the day and time the lines and parking can't be a pain but I still go. I used to go to LA Kush but their prices are ridiculous. Love the herb, edibles, and vapes. Those 40s are bomb too!"
1460,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月30日,Welp Yelp! Most people have their happy place whether it's in their heads or a physical one! With that being said STIIIZY is my happy place. After every trip I have my own happy trip (not really a trip more of a relax therapy session) their products are all bomb! Just today I picked up their gelato 41 full gram pod and a cotton candy syrup! Being coming here for 2 plus years and haven't had a bad experience once. Thank you all
1461,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月6日,DO not waste your money. I didn't go in store since I am on the east coast. NOTHING But issues. I HAVE BOUGHT 3 and they are all TRASH.  I am beyond mad that i wasted time and money on such a POS product. Buy from literally anyone else.
1462,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月27日,This place has everything plus some. I came here for some flowers and left with more than I bargained for weight wise due to daily deals. Carmen helped me find what I needed and even recommended anything she had tried herself. She was knowledgeable on products and was very thorough and professional. Check online for daily deals and def recommend your friends they'll get a great deal for first time and you get credit too. Pro tip come with cash- or there's multiple ATMS before check in area and even after check in there are some. Happy shopping.
1463,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月3日,"Always great service and knowledgeable staff!! Thank you, Aylin, for the help. You rock!!!"
1464,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月1日,Horrible place. They don't pay money to contractors. I have 50 more people who didn't get paychecks from april 2023.
1465,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月21日,"stiiizy as a brand NEVER AGAIN!!The pod idea is great but the product sucks big time. I've bought several different pods different strains & flavors.  When it works it's great, when it doesn't it really sucks.I have all the stiiizy paraphernalia, probably $300-500 worth.  Never again, they don't back their product, can't even get ahold of anyone!  I have no idea which store I've purchased products from.  One stiiizy store says the warranty is only 7 days! WHAT, are you kidding me?  I'don't even know what store I purchase the pod at and I'm supposed to keep the receipt?I have 12 pods with different flavors & strains at various levels of use.  I also have 4 pods that are either new or GT 3/4 full that don't work at all.  When I take it to a store they ask for the receipt and when did I buy it?  How am I supposed to know?  I like 1 so I spend $35-$55 for EACH ONE and now I have 4 TOTALLY BAD pods that don't do $41T!  Talk about a bad product with no backing or backbone from the company.  NEVER AGAIN!"
1466,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月27日,This place is always good vibes (except for parking)  but I want to S/O budtender Ashley. A lot of good people work here but she has been the nicest! Service always on point!
1467,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月26日,"A friend recommended me here, before that I hadn't been in a shop for years. Walking into this establishment felt like walking into a kids candy store. The place is spacious. The check-in is easy. The service is on point, and the product is top notch. They got deals running everyday too! Definitely choose this spot over all other just based on the awesome vibes."
1468,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,"The service is great, tenders know what they are selling & very helpful in helping find exactly what I was looking for in. The selection is huge , they have a bit of everything."
1469,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月12日,"For basically a warehouse store they're always out of everything. And for WEEKS at a time. I remember going in only 5 days into the month and they were already out of all their monthly deals - fyi they'll be out for the rest of the month. Also, if they mess up and give you an indica instead of a sativa, they won't exchange it because ""it's already gone through the system"" even though it was their fault. I've been a Stiiizy customer for years but at this point I say go somewhere else."
1470,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月4日,Always out of stock they can't keep up with the demand and I also can tell the employees are fake nice.
1471,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月7日,"Absolute worst and fake customer service.  The smiley and cheerful facade melted immediately upon receiving a request to right a wrong on their end.  Products put into my bag were not what I selected.  Upon inspection of my pouch in the lobby, I returned inside to exchange for selected items no more than one minute after purchaseAfter explaining my situtation to no less than 3 counter people, General Manager Alex was summoned and I had to repeat the whole situation again, even though he had already been informed of my request to right the wrong.  He was haughty, snobby, rude and refused to correct their error.  He said that he could but stated, ""No, I'm not going to do it for you""  in a detached manner, as if he deliberately wanted to irritate and not satify this customer.Let the buyer beware and check your purchase before entering their Lobby, whereby you will be responsible for their mistakes.  Karma ensures that what comes around goes around, General Manager Alex.Heavy handed aggressive security people attempt to intimidate customers."
1472,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月4日,"Really sucks that you can't give zero stars honestly, I've been going to stiiizy for a long time in the IE. I recently relocated to LA they make it a huge deal over returning product that doesn't work like nobody's going to be throwing their money away in reality then they make it seem like it's your fault and call support. We can't help you like first you tell people seven days defective, blah blah blah, and then oh no well it's less than halfway or it's not showing leaking. It's hitting fine. Always beating around the bush. Just tell people there's no exchanges don't put false advertisement out there. Time is money and at the end of the day nobody wants to be back-and-forth wasting their time and their gas."
1473,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月1日,Place and location is amazing! Never seen anything like it so if you're going here for the first time go for it! There was a whole lot of deals that are actually steals! Just always has a line but hey that's just L.A
1474,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月15日,Never ever buy these. They are extremely bad. Smoke like the worst thing ever. The leave a lot of sticky and nasty grim on your fingers and lips. It is waaAaay too expensive. Even G. White glasses tall should never ever help anyone or recommend something that they have 0 clue too. Also managers do not try to help you out in any way with what just feels like a scam. Overpaid and the quality is horrible. Thank you for saving me money in the future by not leaving tenders a tip moving forward because of the poor approach as to the situation. Brush my teeth wash and my hands and smell was still horrible after:
1475,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月12日,Waited 15 mins in line for them not to accept Apple Pay. They had no sings at all that they don't accept it yet they want to say they have a discrepancy with Apple Pay and online it says they accept it.
1476,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月24日,"STIIZY might come off as a convenient dispensary and store to most, but the things that happen behind the scenes do not back up that idea. Employees are being undermined and left out of vital meetings and conversations when they are assets to the company itself. The company is scared of something new, and fears having someone with a good work history in taking over what they cannot handle. STIIZY is intimidated by those who bring forth ideas that will ONLY help promote the company, but I guess they rather stay in their small bubble and not grow. To each theirs own, I guess."
1477,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月17日,"I need to counteract all the bad reviews. Because I've been going here for 2 years and literally, LITERALLY, I've never had a problem. If I do, they help me out. I dunno what you guys are talking about with bad service and everything, but every budtender is super friendly with me and super professional. Maybe you guys just don't have manners and that's why the budtender aren't nice. Or you're dumb and don't know what you're getting. Stiiizy is the best weed brand and the best dispensary that I've ever been to."
1478,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月30日,Love going to stiizy. Always fast service thr staff is always super nice and love the deals they have every week.
1479,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月2日,"Big variety, great price, good quality :).    I like to get stiiizy brand flower & pods, don't miss out"
1480,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月6日,Out of nowhere they do not allow dogs to go inside any longer. There are no signs posted anywhere. Wasted my time trying to come here. At least the security guard was nice about it I guess.
1481,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月22日,"i've been gone here for almost 2 years and every time I go, it gets worse and worse and worse, the selection is lackluster and now they have a POS system that barely worksis that enough you can't smell the weed"
1482,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月10日,Dishonest about the monthly deals. They tell you to look online for deals then won't give you the deal advertised when you go in.
1483,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月14日,"So finally made a date to come check out the stiiizy store!!!I wasn't impressed. There's a lot happening everywhere. People yelling and heavy crowds.The parking was rough!Do take your phone because they have QR codes available to check out deals. ( not many)For a first timer I had to guess everything.They ask you questions, and then they bring product.They ask for your ID twice!But how do I know they are bringing out the worthy product? Not just the needs to be sold so we Amp up our vibe shiet!! Flower is sold in New package with dark tint glass jars. Lol for freshness. Yeah, right  more like so you really can't see what you're buying!!All their pods show different products, and some are not available.Edible new packages are not my favorite. But they came through quick!I felt like it's forbidden to ask about any other product other than Stiiizy. Then the warning after you pay!!!! You have 7 days to bring back your stiiizy pods!! Wait what?!?$50 taxes!! In the end I really couldn't tell you what my first time discount was!!They have online ordering and express line to pick up!"
1484,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月13日,Awesome for babes cdt or Og edibles diamonds flowers or anything else pioneers! Go to stiiizy I've been to all of their Southern California locations as well as the Detroit locations and they were all two thumbs up
1485,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月30日,Stiiizy DTLA fails in customer service and compassion once again by selling products labeled one way with a completely a different product on the inside. The guy who helped me when I got there to hopefully get an exchange sounded like he was trained to be a robot. When he returned from the management he just repeated the same droned out response over and over again. The manager/s just hid away like cowards making their cronie handle the customer that they are wronging. If I could give no stars I would but I know I'll still end up going back to these degenerates because unfortunately they have great prices...  so yeah a shitty review for them but they still get my money not sure how I feel about that.
1486,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月20日,Been with stizzy since long time instead I heard the corporation where you get it kills the name so Daniel Izquierdo forever with stizzy my repesct that Im sober .
1487,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月22日,My go to for stiiizy pods and other related products like chocolate bars and drinks !
1488,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月10日,These guys SUCK!  ALL of the STIIIZY locations SUCK! They are rude and they don't delivery when promised.
1489,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月23日,"Hot garbage! Pick ups always bug out and are somehow always out of stock for EVERYTHING and they won't even notify you they'll just stay quiet and act like nothing happened. Just waited 2 hours after they already accepted my order, called them to ask for an update and they tell me they have items out of stock in my order and tell me to just come in talk to a budtender. Problem with that is that all these budtenders don't even know what the fuck they're talking about! On top of that they all act like they've never had any social interactions in their life...Me: you have moxie wax in stock?Budtender: uhh no we're outMe: *looking right at it on the shelf behind him*        Bruh it's right thereBudtender: oh I didn't see that my badProceeded to happen like 3 more times, asked for an Elyon 1/8th, ""oH thOsE ArenT iN StOCk."" Yet I see them behind him on the shelf again....These people are idiots. They don't update their pick up website and they're careless about helping the customers. A JOKE. Would give 0 stars if I could. So careless."
1490,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月27日,"Absolute trash. I used to be in love with their stiiizy pods up until two months ago when all of a sudden majority of my pods started coming out defective. 7 day policy? I hardly use my pods now, two weeks in, I'm half way through at out of no where they give out. Such a huge business and they make it impossible to help out and at least give me a discount since it's only half way. No I don't charge it with it in. Yes I put the pod cover on it after every use. It's bull. I keep coming back but I'm so over it. Don't waste your money. Just bought the new pineapple hybrid and guess what (: half way and it STOPPED HITTING. Not my battery either because I bought another one thinking it was the problem and wasn't. So over this brand."
1491,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月26日,Trash. Tunred away from out of state cause workers are too incompetent to understand how to read an out of state ID.
1492,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月2日,For a clinic That is so about the community you would think that they wouldn't fuck over the community so often they constantly are changing their deals and not telling anyone until you are already in the store and not honoring the Old deals even though you expect a specific price and nowhere on their website does it say that the deal have changed? They are scummy they are pieces of shit and I am so tired of this fucking clinic. I will not be coming here anymore.  You lost a loyal customer who would come every week change your shit deal policy's
1493,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月20日,"I really like Stiiizy and will continue to come, but I really wish you would improve the quality of your pods or batteries?They get clogged for no reason. I don't take massive rips, I don't overheat, I keep them upright, i don't drop them, and I charge it without the pod. Im really not understanding why this has been happening for the last 2 months and never happened before. Sending much love and some food for thought.I hope this gets resolved.I see i am not the only one going through it. =(Love, a loyal customer"
1494,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月2日,"I hated the vibe of this place. Came here with my friend who was excited to go, as it was close to our hotel in little tokyo. We realized it wasn't the best area to walk through, but it was the middle of the day and we had no problems. Armed guards in the parking lot- okay. But then you walk in and there are armed guards EVERYWHERE. I understand it is a large warehouse and there are safety concerns for the workers and product, but being made to feel like a criminal is not the vibe. We went to another dispensary earlier in the day and the armed guard was nice and friendly. We both had to check in and make accounts with them- something I do not like. Obviously they have to check our IDs but I wasn't buying anything and the guard still took photos of both sides of my ID. However, the person inside serving us was super nice and helpful. The vibe inside is kind of cool if you like influencer/techno modern/LED everywhere. They are also cash only but have multiple ATMs around."
1495,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月23日,The security in the parking lot must be so bored. They got like 12 guys micromanaging which of the 15 empty spaces you gotta park in and god forbid you roll up on a bike they will think you're from Mars or something.
1496,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月18日,Abby was so rude! I'm not sure if She gave me her real name but She was at the register 14 on Oct-19-22 at 3:56pm. She didn't want to help or introduce any products to us. She keep asking us to look on the website. This is my first time here and probably my last. Waste of my time and money.
1497,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月9日,"The Vape pods are constantly leaking, you will not get your moneys worth do you not buy this product. I went in this week and the pod was not working at all, so I came back to exchange it. They did exchange it but of course it started leaking, I let them know when I inhaled and got a mouthful of wax and the person working the counter was trying to tell me that was normal. What??!!!! It's literally leaking product, last night I hit the Vape and it got completely clogged so now it looks like it's drained because all the wax is stuck. $45 down the drain, I was literally spending $200 here a month and will never go back again. Take your business somewhere else."
1498,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月14日,I loved Ashley  she made my first experience in a dispensary the easier and most fun!!
1499,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月5日,"Really poorly handled situation with my pod of hell, the thing spit back so much wax at me. Then I remember that you can return them from what the bud tender told me. So I did that. And they wouldn't take it since it states in small letters ""you need the original packaging"" on a receipt they send you that goes to SPAM. Truly Stiiizy let people know that.... When I asked if they can let future customers know this they got smart with me and had attitude. Like I'm just trying to help."
1500,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月8日,"What I've liked the best coming to this downtown location is the staff, which includes the incredible security teams. I'm 62+ years old, disabled and handicapped. Most wouldn't know it, whereas I can walk and talk, compared to the over 90% that can't who've broken their neck. I broke my back, as well. I'm riddled with titanium plating and screws. I've got permanent never damage, living in some level of pain 24/7/365. The Stizzy products have been a top producer of pain-relief vapes. The Indica allows me to sleep peacefully for hours, not waking up in pain. The Hybrids allow me a more enjoyable day living with a tad less pain. I'm enjoying my life the best I can. Thankful for each waking minute. Bottom line, I really like how the staff treats this old guy, and I'm more than happy with all Stizzy has to offer. Ty!"
1501,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月21日,"The staff does not know it's own prices. They quote 20 percent off then only give you 2 percent. If you ask why they say "" Woops"". Total scam. Stay away. The brand is ruined by this store. The people who work there. It's really bad. Starting with the manager. What a joker."
1502,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月25日,lets go smoke  appreciate rodrigo c. for letting me know about deals & thank yall gang gang shout out  im from los angeles lets win
1503,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月25日,Horrible just horrible Staff is rude you wait forever and they rush you worst experience ever I walked out didn't even bother to make a purchase

1505,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月25日,"I'm so confused, thought I was buying weed, but its just cbd or some shiiit. The shake I bought in the 1990s packed more punch than this crap. Don't waste your money"
1506,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月14日,"Great place with great services.  The warehouse is here too and it is huge.  Staff is courteous and wearing gloves.  Busy location but easy to get to off the 101 union station exit, Vignes, and from Alameda streets.  Plenty of parking but busy.  Bring  meter money as parking may be in short supply and construction is in progress off Center street."

1508,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月20日,Just came to grab some pods and the bud tender Emma was amazing ! Super friendly and super helpful ! She definitely let me know about the great deals and made the experience great ! Will definitely be back !!
1509,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月6日,"Save time. Order online for pick- up. Skip the line. With that said. Your Biiig Batteries are ridden with design flaws. The wires that connect to the motherboard are basically suspending the battery (literally hanging). I had to purchase 3 batteries in the last 6 months. Their cope out shit Limited Warranty of a month is worthless. They really should be handing out these devices for free. Like if your CEO has a tiny amount of cerebral mass, they will understand that hanging the customer with a piece of garbage dispenser can only take you so far. I spend here monthly what some people pay for a shared rent in LA. I should not have to use this medium nor do my own research to find a reliable way to use YOUR product. You are fortunate your pods are mostly fire. Let's be real, sometimes one gets a shit pod that is mostly sulphur derivatives. Stop gouging us. Deliver outstanding products, that's what you built on. This having to continually to repurchase a battery is a deal breaker. I can't hit your product with a flawed dispenser that continually fails and breaks down. I have even in writing from your subpar support staff that the Battery is a hit and miss. This is not a rag on Stiiizy, more like a call to accountability. I wish to continue to foster our business relationship, but you will need to make a Battery that delivers. I have pods I can't use because I am not about to purchase another shit Battery. In closing, I will file a complaint, but I will need your help fellowship. If you have a Battery that has failed and Stiiizy has failed to address the issue, consider this: If a letter to the manager does not resolve the problem, you may want to file a complaint with the following: Department of Consumer Affairs. File a complaint online at www.dca.ca.gov or call 800.952. 5210 to have a complaint form mailed to you.Next I may use my Stiiizy money and seek Legal Counsel or even produce a better Battery than this POS Stiiizy Biiig. I am certain this may get their attention. Vty,A Caring Betrayed Customer. Fix your sh$t."
1510,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月8日,"Bought a brand new disposable from a very reputable dispensary. It has totally stopped working! It will not draw and I believe the battery has crapped out also! I still have a 1/2 gram left! I DO NOT RECOMMEND any of their disposable products and on their regular products if they use them  production company, I would stay clear of them!"
1511,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月27日,Dope dispensary with a large variety of goods. The prices aren't so bad either. Location location location! It shows because there were lots of folks coming thru.
1512,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月3日,"I was a very loyal customer of this shop UNTIL tonight!! I tried to get a refund on 2 brand new pods that I bought yesterday, only to have the ""manager"" tell me that I couldn't get an exchange for 1 because it only had 10% of the pod left  yea ok, it was at half before they took it away to be ""tested"". AND THEN I was told I couldn't get an exchange or refund on my other pod because it passed their ""tests"" How THE FUCK Is A Stupid MACHINE going to determine if my pod tastes EXTRA BURNT AND SHITTY???? According to the machine it was fine but taking a hit from it left a nasty burnt aftertaste in the back of my throat  I love weed and this is bullshit. Almost $100 just down the drain  THANKS STIIIZY YOU MONEY STEALING ASSHOLES!!!!!!"
1513,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月15日,"The only place I will buy my products! And to be honest, the only products I smoke are Stiiizy products. If you're buying flower, Black Truffle is fire. For extracts, their rosin is so tasty and smooth! We all know Stiiizy pods are unmatched but if you're looking for something more flower relatable, try the live resin pods!"
1514,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月27日,"I come here a lot, it's probably not good that I need to rely on marijuana for my anti-anxiety medication but I do and I've spent roughly $20,000 here in a years time. I bring my nine-year-old golden retriever every time.  They let me know today that dogs are no longer welcome after several years of visiting the store together.  I was pretty upset about the daily deals changing from every day to just Monday and Friday for wax; then a month later they changed it to just Wednesdays.  I feel bad for the skinny guy that's nice that has to tell the dog owners no, you could tell he was uncomfortable delivering the news to me."
1515,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月26日,They treat you like family and very helpful. I love the atmosphere! The employee (forgive me for being bad with names) explained to me what was better for my medical condition and to function properly.
1516,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月26日,Parking is horrible. Staff is horrible. Management is horrible. Their flower is horrible. Their battery is horrible. Basically horrible company.
1517,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月28日,Normally come here but tonight... I spend almost 60$ after tax for a cartridge and the oil is BLACK  won't exchange my product after I bought it because it was functional on a battery without signs of issue. This cart is an issue!
1518,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月2日,Horrible customer service. Stizzy brands sell defective pods and won't exchange when returned within 7 days.
1519,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月9日,They sell faulty products with a strict return policy. It's honestly a waste of money. One of the worst experiences I've ever had. It was my first time buying from them and definitely my last.
1520,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月14日,"amazing my first dispensary and it was sooo nice and organized had aesthetic, the workers were very friendly and helpful i just loved the whole ambiance and high end vibes of it"
1521,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月17日,"The best way to get Stiiizy products is from the source. This is a cool location with good Budtenders.  Huge selection of Stiiizy products from concentrates, pods and flower."
1522,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月18日,"This place is run very smoothly, I don't frequent but both times I did the place was busy, well kept, and experienced fast moving lines if any."
1523,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月23日,"Love this shop, got a great range of prices for flower and wax. Personally the honey leaf carts are my favorite they are affordable and always smack, never had an issue with it. Also the edibles and flower are the best quality for the price. The only issue I had is with the stiiizy disposables the battery would die out with half the wax in it and when they told me to come in and they'll exchange it, they told me to just buy a new one so I just stay away from them but the stiiizy pods are always good. If you want a lighter colored oil always get the newer packages carts/pods."
1524,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月29日,Great customer service. Offer curbside pick up place your order on line parking is super limited but they have attendants and security. Regardless of covid or not you will most likely have to wait in line outside I walked up to 4 people in line waited 4 mins when I came out the line was about 20 people deep. If you do curbside you can skip line and walk to counter. There's also a good truck posted up on curb in case you get hungry.
1525,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月15日,"As a long time, loyal customer of Stiiizy, it saddens me to have to write this review, but three days after the following occurred, I am still upset by the way I was treated, all over a defective Chinese made Stiiizy battery exchange gone badly.  Spend your money elsewhere.Very early on February 13, 2022, I walked into the Downtown L.A. Stiiizy store to purchase a few Stiiizy cartridges and to exchange a defective Stiiizy battery that I purchased from them earlier in the week. Imagine my shock when the two employees put their heads together and informed me that would have to charge the battery first to see if it works (like I have time to waste). I could not believe what I was hearing and asked for a manager (making me look like a Karen, when the problem was that these two half-baked teenagers thought I wanted a cash refund vs. what I really wanted, which was a simply a battery that works.Did they not believe me? Did they really expect me to wait around for them to charge the battery (how long would that take, anyway?), only to find later I was right? Would they be giving me a gift for wasting my time? I still cannot believe Stiiizy is so short-sighted to lose a longtime, cash paying customer, one that easily drops $1,000 a month (I have a bad back) over a $50 defective Chinese made battery, but I guess they have since I will never go back there after the way I was treated.I encourage you to spend your money anywhere but here.  L.A. Kush near Cal State L.A. is pretty good - just stay away from the L.A. Kush batteries - they suck and you cannot exchange a defective battery after 7 days.  But at least they are upfront about not backing up their product, unlike Stiiizy.  And L.A. Kush batteries are $10, not $50.  (Since I cannot give 0 stars, I gave 5 stars so Stiiizy cannot bury my review.)"
1526,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月13日,Good experience everytime I come never misses and always can trust the products here thank you Stiizy!
1527,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月17日,"Difficult parking. Check in is a little tedious. Pretty quick moving lines. Asked for ID twice, once at the door and again at register. Got a 10% discount for coming in on my first time. Lady didn't thank me for the tip. 50/50 Stiiizy is cheaper at Cookies."
1528,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月10日,"Visited for my first time on the evening before Thanksgiving day. I've only ever visited the SF Mission location, so I was surprised at how much bigger this storefront is. The interior has some awesome art, lights, and displays. The wait was longer than I anticipated. First, there's a line outside where they take your temperature before entering, then you wait in a second line where they check you in with your ID, then there is a third line you have to wait in once inside when waiting to be helped. They do enforce social distancing and masks, so I felt safe during my visit. Unfortunately, they didn't have first time patient deals at the time. Can't wait to go back!"
1529,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月10日,this is about my second time going to this STIIIZY store and it's been nothing but wonderful. the workers are great people especially  Bianca Kim . she was super helpful recommending me flavors was super patient. would definitely come back again this place is amazing
1530,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月31日,"Unfortunately this place is falling apart. Quality control is out the window. Flower being sold that was packaged a year ago, employees not knowing product whatsoever, and if I'm told over the phone that you guys have certain product I am going to expect to be able to buy it 10 minutes later when I enter the store. Do yourself a favor and avoid the ridiculous lines, do some product research on your own time and get your product elsewhere with a properly trained staff who actually care about the product they push and not which ""pod flavor"" tastes best."
1531,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月1日,The store is really top notch products are 100% legit the service and prices are what's best imo they have a price range to meet any budget have gone back twice since my initial visit
1532,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月21日,"Fo-Stiiizy!I popped in because my boss told me this was a clothing store I bought anything but clothing. However they do have a store line of clothing and accessories. I don't know if you are allowed to take photographs but it's a super cute and clean store.Staff was super friendly, no complaints.Product: They have a wide selection. Everyday they have a different special going on. New clients get 10% discount that can be saved for a later day. On the day I went they were all out of my fav pre rolls Parking: they have a free parking lot. Just remember Stoners go to the store, and sometimes don't know how to park. I would recommend to park outside or meters parking if you can't find a free one."
1533,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月26日,"Super long lines. What a colossal waste of time for  Average weed. Awful location, after jumpingover a few bums and waiting 40 min.... prices just as much as anywhere else. 20 people in line at 10:00 on Sunday who the F wants to wait for weed when you can get it anywhere now. Never coming again."
1534,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月28日,"Visited on a Wednesday afternoon and luckily it wasn't busy and there were no lines. The location is huge, and it felt like walking into a large department store.  Very cool location and the parking lot is ample. Check in is fast and easy for Recreational users (just a scan of your ID) and having a Medical recommendation would only allow you to purchase a higher limit of flower or concentrates and do not have any FTP deals.You are probably wondering why I gave them 2 stars. The Product itself is top shelf and excellent quality. The hosts were nice and quick to get you in and out.  However the customer service interaction between the budtender and patient was seriously lacking during my visit. This is the most important piece of the sale, and think STIIIZY should focus on training their budtenders to be friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Today, they must have had at least 30 budtenders helping customers. I get you have to move the line as fast as possible, and that it can get busy, but it wasn't busy at the time I went. The budtender I was directed to was rude, did not know anything about the products I was interested in, and told me incorrect details about what is in stock. I went along with another friend and she said her budtender was nice, but when she asked a question about a concentrate, Her budtender had told her "" I only smoke flower and not concentrates, so I can't help you with that question"" In an event like this, I think the employee should probably reach out to another trained employee to help answer any Medicinal questions that may arise from customers ready to buy. My budtender, made me feel rushed (again it wasn't busy), was not helpful, and told me that they were out of specific live resins. She brought over what was left in stock  and it was only 3 choices.  After I checked out, I found out from my other friend whom dealt with a different budtender, that there was a plethora of live resins available and she got other live resins that I had my eye on from the WM menu, but was told that they were out of stock. With all the TV screens, tech and huge walls, they should have a live in-stock menu up somewhere. It would help customers (and budtenders) know what is available, the costs, etc. In My case, I could have and would have spent more, but was told that there was no stock, when there was."
1535,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月1日,"This is just about pick up service. I was waited in lobby for 40 min, and after I waste my time there, I am going to pick up my order at schedule time, and they said - we don't have your items in stock. This is all what you need to know about pick up."
1536,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月1日,"G'd up from the feet up. These guys are LeGiT LA legends.  much love to the security, strapped up ready to clap . Fuck around and find out spot, no doubt. love y'all."
1537,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月17日,"The line was ridiculously long but aside to that this place was very clean, organized, and professional. Make sure to take cash!"
1538,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月4日,"I placed my order at 6 Pm for 6 items. I placed it for curbside delivery on there website, and it said it would be ready at 8 pm.So I make my way on over there at 8 pm and the lady tells me it will be ready in 45 minutes and they usually call/text when it's ready. So I go back home for the time being expecting a phone call, I get no phone call or text. So at 9:30pm , I call them and ask them what's going ? The lady tells me she can't get in contact with the packaging team on the phone and that I can try to come into the store to place an order... and also they stop accepting people at 9:50. She proceeds to tell me the lines out the door, and basically I just wasted 4 hours of my time."
1539,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月16日,"Can't believe they can take a single order right.The workers here need to come sober to work.Bud tender messed up on a simple order.When I noticed I was almost home so I turned back and said today I got time. So I went back.Besides parking far when I went in there and told them what happened they started treating me a little rude like I did something bad like I messed up.And of course I only brought back the stuff I was returning and then the the girl not even a lady told me all rude to go back to the car to go get the rest. ""Excuse me"" so I went all the way back because today I got time. I showed her the and was like am so going to get a free joint for doing all this extra work that I didn't messed up on because y'all came high to work and can even take the right order? All rude she said are you going to tip me. I was like what? Again after y'all messed up and made me walk all the way back to the car? She was like yeah and I was like nah your out of your mind. I finally got my exchange back just to find out they didn't have the flavors any more. End up getting other random stizzy flavors. Anyways what the hell. Where y'all manners and professionalism and costumer service?Y'all need to get tested smh no flower for y'all if y'all can work under the influence. Rookies.And they didn't even give me a receipt."
1540,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月11日,I'm new when it comes to this. So I don't know the ins and outs. I purchased a new pod and battery 10/21. I opened the pod 2days ago and it's defective. I use if I need for bad anxiety. I'm not interested in going beyond a stiiizy pod for my anxiety.  What's frustrating is that these pods are so easily defective. Unfortunately I got to donate my full defective pod back with nothing for my anxiety when it comes on. Disappointed that the new diluted quality standard in America is going strong. Unfortunately I'm open shopping smaller shop looking for better quality. I can't afford defective. Unfortunately 2x was to much. Please be aware of what your buying. Shameful more care isn't taken in making these. If you use for anxiety like me be even more aware I'm thinking to try someplace new that's not stiiizy.  I need better made products. Point is to destress not stress over poorly made product.
1541,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月21日,"A LA staple, must visit dispensary when in Downtown!California has one of the most elaborate marijuana markets in all of the world and getting a full immersive experience is a must when purchasing. Lots of options ranging from edibles, disposables, concentrates, cartridges and flower, and offering a variety of choices in price/quality/strain. The sheer amount of options to choose from can be overwhelming, but it is really nice to have when you know what youre looking for. The budtenders are always knowledgeable and are helpful at finding the right products for you if you are struggling/ are looking to try something new or different.The long line moves fast and it feels like you're in a mall when you first walk in the room with product.You have to try the real deal if you like cannabis and are in LA."
1542,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月31日,"really disappointed. I've been coming here for awhile now and haven't had problems, but I bought a live resin pod and it stopped working after about a week. I wasn't even half way through it but when I came to the store for an exchange or at least a discount on a new one they refused because it had been more than a week since purchasing. like, I understand people can take advantage but this is my first ever conplaint on an EXPENSIVE product. they lost a customer :/"
1543,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月24日,"I had a great time visiting Stiiizy DTLA! The employees were sooo friendly even at 7am!! They were very safe during the Covid-19. I felt like it was very clean. They didn't have everything I needed of vapes pods out of the whole huge place! They didn't have the Engraving like it says on the website my husband took me there to celebrate and he asked for the engraving and the girl said oh no we don't do that, she said I don't think we have ever done that... I was bummed they didn't have the merchandise like the pod pillow or big stiiizy pillow. I was happy but I felt like I didn't get everything I wanted because they were out of several things. Great place to visit if your looking to take a road trip.."
1544,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月10日,"There is security at the very first door to the building, then when you go though the second door, there are receptionists who were quite welcoming they jot down basic info off your I'd and tell you a little about what deals that have going on. They then walkie talkie you in as you walk through sliding doors that open to a hall where it then leads you to where the magic is. LolThe have a wide selection from flower, and wax, to pods, and edibles. The young lady helping me was super informative and made my first visit here pleasant."
1545,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月4日,"Listen this isn't my first time around the block or at a dispensary. It was definitely impressive and as a first time customer we got HOOKED up with deals. Not saying it's cheap but it's a sight you should see. Massively impressive. However the star of the show was the person assisting us - Vicky, she made our whole experience honestly. She was incredibly kind, knowledgeable and SUPER patient with 3 overly excited young ladies. Not a small feat. She answered any and all questions we had, and explained everything from what the name of the brand is to what deals they typically have. 20 out of 10 for her customer service, she left us with a huge smile on our face!! I will be back no question"
1546,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月20日,"this was my go to dispensary when i had my med card. the lines can seem intimidating but it tends to go by fairly quickly.customer service varies. when i first started going here, it was exceptional and honestly kept me coming back. throughout the years, it seems to have gone downhill but there are still some good people. i mainly shop here for their deals, they've got the best selection and their prices are unbeatable. it's still cash only so make sure to bring some change! they close pretty early, like around 9:20/9:30 PM so if you're planning on going late, it's better to visit earlier or the next day otherwise you'll be declined at the door. parking is tricky. sometimes you can snatch a great spot in their lot, other times it'll be so packed you have to drive around a bit to find a metered spot. overall it is a solid dispensary, absolutely worth a visit! the venue is so pretty, everyone is always impressed with how pretty the set up is inside."
1547,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月25日,"Okay, I am not one to leave bad reviews. But, this needs to be know because it isn't my first time this happens with them. I smoke nothing but flower, and picking up from Stiizy is really my last options because reality their weed sucks, I KNOW THAT. But, I was running late and it's on my way home so I thought I'll give another try! BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT for 10738 time. So I decided to come here and address it! DO NOT buy weed from them. Their weed is absolutely the most dry weed ever!!I mean you touch it and it breaks! I been a weed smoker for 15+ years and when I tell you their weed sucks, it SUCKS!!"
1548,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月5日,"Expedited service and friendly bud tenders are a regular here at Stizzy. My favorite are the Stizzy brand edibles, cartridges and Dank You 8ths."
1549,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月18日,Unable to smell product until you go home realizes it's bs weed over priced they very friendly tho
1550,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月25日,"First time here and I must say,  WOW! They do a great job .  The whole process was fun and easy. The selection was insane and staff was super knowledgeable and friendly. If you're going to spend upwards of 100$ on cannabis products this is the place to do it! They have rewards system. Aesethiscs were 10/10, high ceilings, lots of art, very well lit. This is the future of Cannabis ladies and gentlemen. Don't forget to tip!!"
1551,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月12日,A pleasant experience. Got parking as soon as we drove up. Checked in with ID. I don't like that in 2020 a place like this does not take debit cards. Cash only.The pens and weed we got were good. Purple punch. Was packed in April of 2019 so it was a little dry.The only thing I didn't like was our bud tender. I asked her for wax and she told me it was illegal. Um no it's not...Also asked if they had plants/seeds and she laughed at me and said that was Illegal for them to sell. Um again no. She also told my boyfriend not to talk while she was ringing us up because she messed up before and charged someone wrong. How? When u scan everything? Took a while for her to ring us up. She had to go through it like 3 times and found her mistakes. I'll go back and hopefully get a bud tender that is more knowledgable of laws and regulations.
1552,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月21日,"I used to love stiiizy up until last year 2020 June their service is basic there is always a LONG ass line and I purchased some wax today that had been packed in August 2020 it was crusty hard and dark smelled weird too. I know what butter looks like. And they didn't want to exchange it or give me my money back because it was ""final sale""  HORRIBLE I highly recommend Buddha Company tho :)"
1553,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月23日,Why is everyone always in bad mood. Y'allNeed to add some light colors to your uniforms. Black shirt make you guys act like y'all work at a cemetery!!! The girl scanning is the only one who smiles
1554,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月15日,"I've been dropping $2k a month at stiiizy consistently. I went in today to fully restock my flower and concentrates. With only 2 people in line behind me I asked the security guard if I could wait for a specific bud tender than I knew was knowledgeable and had a great experience with. He rudely tells me no and that I need to go to whatever pod opens next. I purchased a pod and left. This is not the first bad experience I've had with service there. You guys are a business and continue to treat customers like you're doing them a favor. We can choose to give our money to any of the hundreds and hundreds of shops in our city.  For the culture, yeah right. On to a better shop that appreciates their customers.Update: now I'm getting aggressive comments from Stiiizy burner accounts that say things to me then block me before I can respond. Rad."
1555,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月20日,stiiizy pods leak way too much trash asf the bud is weak and garbage now customer service terrible
1556,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月20日,Bought a biig battery that only lasted 2 months. On top of that I come to buy another and I get denied entrance because my military id is not scannable but up to date
1557,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月12日,This is one of my favorite dispensaries Everyone here knows their stuff n very friendly If I'm the area it's a must to stop in
1558,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月29日,"Man this is horrible. As a regular customer, I shouldn't be getting turned awya waaaaay before closing time. Wtf is going on stiizy? This is seriously not ok. Obey your hours of operation."
1559,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月27日,"First time coming here and honestly I can say I'm pretty impressed. Employees were welcoming, super quick check in, helpful and well educated on the products. I was super stoked knowing also that they are probably the only place that has baby jeeters which is fucking awesome. Alex's eyes literally lit up as I asked for them... cool vibes and we love them reasonable prices."
1560,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月23日,"In the dire age of ""essential work"", cannabis workers and users are relieved to have a way to consume their cannabis needs. Having no medicine available during a mandated lockdown will push many even casual users into a dysphoric mania that can only be relieved by that which is tantalizingly kept away from them. Luckily, Stiiizy is essential and is an incredible dispensary to make that quick stop. They provide delivery service through Blaze Delivery and have many companies of flower, concentrates, edibles, and CBD products to ease anyone's mind. The prices are reasonable. They even have quarters of budlets from Pacific Stone and Elyon Flower for 25 dollars. I bought one gem that is in my top five strains called Pink Picasso, available through Wonderbrett Company. I love it because it is an incredible sativa with an aptitude for keeping creative flow and connections alive. Also, the high doesn't make you groggy, but more hyper aware. I got it for 45 dollars an eighth. They have Connected, Alien Labs, and Stiiizy flower too. The atmosphere is much like a Euro club with a runway, amazing budtenders, and good parking."
1561,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月15日,"Weird ass vibes from parking lot to bud tender. Bud tender was weird but not a cool weird but like a rude weird. Like boooooo, this is suppose to be a fun process, he couldn't even give me recommendations when I asked. Isn't that the point of you being there.Highlight was the sweet soul taking temps at the door and the security guard with the dreads."
1562,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月25日,"Excellent service and all of that... Took a walk from Union Station before my bus back to an oasis in the desert, thought about Pupusas but resisted, and also regret it. Entrance was grand, service was excellent. SelectionWas wow with a capital W! I didn't pick up any pods, just pre-rolls for the ride. Service representative was on point, as well as the joints. I am sure to return and take selfie's the next time. Bless up, Jah Rastafari"

1565,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月8日,"The weight was not bad, even for LA the wait time was minimal. Friendly staff and very knowledgeable about the products. Lots of Murch, and lots of pics and pick potential's"
1566,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月27日,2 stars for the rude female bud tenders. If it wasn't for them I'd give 4-5 stars.. I don't get it with these girls who think they can pull attitude for no reason. I'll make sure to give you ladies the same energy when I make all your pumpkin spice lattes lmaoo ;)

1568,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月15日,"As A Stiiizy aficionado it was my surprise to find a retail store that had what I was looking for.My accomplice + I decided to plan out a visit. I'd like to start off with the exterior of the store. Not only was it extremely attracting but it did not prepare me for the wonders that are inside the actual store. You walk in through these beautiful glass doors that seem holy like (gates of heaven). Security guards did not seem intimidating at all but more friendly. Which I enjoy. I hate to go into establishments + feel bombarded. Not at STIIIZY.After the security welcoming us in. We walked into a room where a kind gal took our identification cards. We so pleasantly told us about referring specials, points + weekly specials. Quickly after that the sliding door opened. For a slight second I panicked + imagined myself on Star Trek. Believe me you, that Star Trek feel did not fade. We walked through this hall of lights into the store. From my observation, there are a few counters. To better supply service for when the store has rushes I assume. Which is smart! Let me add that everyone at the team in stiiizy world is epic. Top 3 quality, service + presentation. Quality of stiiizy products is A1. I don't mind the moderate pricing. The service from everyone. The security, the gal at the front + Priscilla! Don't let me forget about our exquisite attendee. She was knowledgeable, fast + friendly. I didn't feel rushed. It was an experience that i could not forget. She made us laugh + had us leaving with excitement to come back. We now have a go to girl.Presentation, the exterior, the interior, the Star Trek-alien v predator-avatar feel of EVERYTHING. 5 for you glen coco. I recommend 100% + will continue to support + spread good word about Stiiizy."
1569,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月26日,I would give it 0 star if I could. Everyone rude and then when I tried my products they are so nasty I literally gave them away... Never Coming Back and all my 200k followers online won't either...
1570,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月23日,The fact I live so far from the shop and decide to drive here they tell me I can't enter because my card was slightly cracked never have they told me it was an issue I'm so mad
1571,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月9日,It was my first time going to stizzy and the staff are awesome. Shout out to Jessica very friendly who helps you get what you looking for. They explain the quality of each product and help you find what you are looking for. Great place to get your stuff .
1572,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月23日,"Waste of my fucking time ordering online with weedmaps. I always come when I receive the ""Your order is ready text"" I go to the store and it's never fucking ready. The receptionist are always lost and don't know shit. All they ever say is ""something happened to your order"" or ""someone took it"". Like okay what the fuck do you not have your eyes on the ""pickup"" station. How hard is it to put 2 half gram cartridges in a stiiizy bag and zip it up?"
1573,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月9日,"Leilani is amazing, I wasn't having the best day but having her help me out today was such a breath blessing."
1574,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月30日,"Came here with a friend... the place looks huge on the outside but there is just a medium sized section for service and guests. I will say though that this place is an experience. They have colorful sliding glass doors that you walk thru, and on the other side bright lights that lead you to the green. Once inside it looks like they have a vast selection of leaves but once you take a closer look, you see that they have the same exact product on both sides.Our tender was very knowledgeable and gave my friend some good recommendations. She also recommended some good CBD items for pain.4 stars for their slow computers/card reader. We needed a purchase to be refunded and it took forever."
1575,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月22日,"Love the set up & the selection. However my bud tender talked waytoo much because he ended up giving me the wrong bud. I asked for Cake Batter and when we got home and opened up the bag, we come to find out we got ""Gas House"".... which we remembered was the one strain the bud tender kept mentioning for us to get because it was HIS favorite... low key annoyed with this because I spent about $40 for the strain we thought we got; but because he was distracted..he ended up putting the wrong item inside our bag...might come back again, but def not to the same guy. UPDATED REVEIW: SHOUTOUT TO KATRINA!!! She was dope af & chill server, definitely would return just for her! She was knowledgeable in the buds, informative, got me hooked up on sum gassssssss !! Such a sweetheart! So shoutout to you girl! Best tender I've had since I started going there."
1576,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月15日,"I've an old dog, around 90 in dog years. He has arthritis so I decided to give him some CBD/THC.Researched and found a reputable product (VET CBD) to try.  Found the best price for it at Stiiizy (DTLA).Oh boy, have times have changed since I bought ""dime bags"" on dark streets. Getting into Stiizy was like going to a bank, a bank with a large deposit of weed! Through reception and security, entered this huge modern vault-like room with high ceilings. I'm welcomed down the center path roped by both sides. There, I waited, as I take in the dazzling sights of images, lights, colors, and products - all accompanied by blaring loud music.  Comforting to see that they are taking precautions and following all of the necessary precautions with the Covid-19 pandemic.  All of their employees wearing masks, gloves, some with a face shield over their mask.The place is full of customers for their essential needs ;-)  Because there are plenty employees, at least 20, it's a very short wait, before an available one beckons me over. Elisa T. (at least that's the name on my receipt) who helped me was very patient with me.  I wanted a second opinion of the product so she took time to go over the product with me....as well as something for my own pains ;-). She also found an employee that actually uses the product on his own dog to give me his insights. It's cash only (they have ATMs with a $2 fee for those that don't carry enough cash on hand.)Oh, give them a call to check for their daily special deals, as I didn't see it online. I believe their deals are for M-F.  I went on a Monday when everything is suppose to be 15% off.  However, apparently what I was buying is ""already discounted so it's not including in the deal.""  Not really sure what the deal is for then. When I inquired about it, I couldn't understand because Elisa was talking through a mask and a face shield with the music blaring.  I did care enough to ask her to repeat since it was the lowest price that I had found.If I could make only one suggestion, turn down the blaring music...cool and hip as it may be, it's hard to hear yourself talk, let alone your employees through their masks and face shields - main reason why I can't give it 5 stars."
1577,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月1日,"Love this place! Great deals! Cheap prices! Called today because I take transit. The receptionist that was working gave me the worse passive aggressive attitude when I asked if the downtown LA location was open and she straight up told me, ""Well I'm answering the phone aren't I. "" Girl. I'm not gonna show up taking the bus walking up to your store and it being closed. It takes not but 1 second to say we open thanks bye. PERIOD. Jesus."
1578,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月31日,"My first time visiting, went on 10/30/2020 and my visit was rather fun.Felt like a kid in a candy factory, lots to see and compare.My experience was rather rushed and dishonest.Was greeted and made me feel welcomed.They check your ID, you're inside within a few minutes and WOW just overwhelms you, this place is HUGE! Before going inside the girl checking people inside said I'll be receiving a 10% off my entire purchase but that wasn't the case.Things got sorted and waited in line, I mentioned the bud tender it's my first time and honestly I felt a little un-welcomed.Once I got sorted out with my items they said the 10% was voided due to having a ""20% off Halloween special."" I read no signs and my receipt showed no such thing but hey I guess that's how it is for us Noobies ay?Overall it was fun! Exciting new experience but I was hoping a bit more interaction and comfy feeling.Will i return? Yeah probably, I like Stiiizy, their products are a bang for your buck. #STIIIZYROCKS"
1579,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月18日,Overrated cheap ass weird expensive $69 3 1/2 gram eighth can't see the weed you're buying the girls are ugly and just over price
1580,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月25日,I waste so much money on these pods getting clogged. As soon as it gets clogged it gets stuck and wasted in two days. These pods don't even last a week without getting stuck and blowing as smooth as the first time opening them.
1581,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月10日,Use to like going here all the time.. they hardly ever answer the phone now and they don't have any deals like they use too.. although idk if that because of everything going on with the economy but regardless... just not willing to spend my hard earned money here anymore.
1582,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月23日,Absolutely love the convenience of this product. We're here for the grand opening. Looking forward to all the new products and access this new retail location has to offer.
1583,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月7日,Just came back from purchasing some dope items!!! Let me tell everyone!! Y'all gotta go n check it out! Dope vibes! And a lot of goodies to get!! STAY STIIIZY
1584,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月16日,"The customer service sure has gone down. Just got helped by ""BiancaG"" , she was rude and impatient when I asked questions about the availability on product . Not the way i expected to be be treated as a paying customer at all but I guess bitches have their days"
1585,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月11日,"The store itself is sick but I won't be returning. My husband and I always go to Connected in Bellflower and we love it because the people are great, what you see is what you get when it comes to the price, they are pretty good at keeping up with stock but stiiizy keeps getting backed up on them. We thought since it's 20% off at the actual  stiiizy store maybe it will be worth it to drive out once a week and stock up for that week and possibly make  a thing of it since I live in Whittier and have no reason to be in LA but I thought it might be worth it. I was verY wrong. Gisele- Treated us like we were a waste of her time, she made some bullshit up about not having a certain  pod and didn't attempt to find out if anyone else had it or not. She was very short and rude in the way she talked to us. I called back to speak to a manager and ask if I was charge correctly  because on weedmaps it said their pods were $25 (which is how much it is at Connected) and I bought 5 of them. Paid $115 for $125 of pods when they were 20% off. First Phone Call- I talked to the first girl on the phone and she was very hostile when I asked to speak to the manager. She first asked me several times why I wanted to tAlk to the manager until I finally told hEr I believed I was over charged and she said ""oh the managers are not in right now."" So which I replied ""so now that I told you what I wanted to speak to the managers about they aren't there?"" She said ""they are busy, they  have meetings and things to do"" (really, stiiizy?) She than kept telling me ""it was policy"" I asked her to read this policy, that she keeps waving in my face, to me and her response was ""if you have a problem you can come down to the store and tell me in person"" that sounded like a threat to me. My husband is a witness to what she said over the phone. I asked her for her name and she lost her mind and hung up on me.Second Call: I called back the girl that answered second took a different approach and pretended to help me but... you bullshitted me, ""sweetie"". She was way more in control and better with her words of manipulation than the other girl was lol so I'll give it to her. It didn't work though, I just hung up at that point.Real classy, stiiizy. I can see you have clearly got some real winners working for you with your brand of professionals. I'll stick with anyone else and that's a shame."
1586,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月27日,They changed their daily deals so don't come on the weekends for 20% and their employee treated me super weird he was soooo faded he asked me a couple times what my order was right after I told him like dude
1587,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月7日,Millennial city !!!! Anyways... took My old ass to get some pods.  Huge selection of everything and everything.  A bit overwhelming.  Cool experience to go and have just to say you've been here.  Cool merch and tons of pod selection.  Daily deals.  I'd go back for sure.  Parking sucks the later you go.  The earlier the better.  But the full experience is best at night.
1588,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月20日,I love coming to the stiiizy store so far all the staff I've encountered have been awesome and give great recommendations! But today the bud tenders seemed to have GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE A little more than normal . I had Celeste help me out in pod 4 she was a REALLY GREAT at helping me choose my selections. Also Amy stepped in and ALSO gave me great recommendations . Thank you two lady's very much! I would love to be helped by them again! Thanks for the great products stiiizy!
1589,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月17日,Was visiting la and thought I'd check out the stiizy store it was HUGE!! All the staff was super super nice!!
1590,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月15日,"Went here last weekend wow what great choices, nice and clean and super customer service"
1591,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月4日,"Hospitality was unreal from the security all the way up to the bud tender. Came in right after a knee injury with crutches and the security hit each other up to help me through. I was ready to wait in line, but they got me right through both lines. It was my first time here and the cashier didn't have what I was looking for but she helped find something similar. Great job to the staff."
1592,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月14日,First time here was today shit looks super dope inside quick in and out only needed a battery but since i was already in there i said why not..
1593,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月1日,"They still keep their 5 star rating. I'm not able to visit as often as I used to, but they're still consistent with the quality of their products and the quality of the experience visiting this location. They now offer a pickup service which is super convenient. Place your order online ahead of time and bypass the line! You'll still wait a little, but on average, I'm in and out in about 15 minutes when I use the pickup option."
1594,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月6日,Literally bought a pod when I was about to leave next thing you know the pod wasn't in the bag haha and then they saying not our responsibility.. It's all good I ain't tripping just think it's funny that's all I would've done something to fix the situation. Management really seem unprofessional & a weird slack of vibe. Therefore it was my first time & will be last you been warned!
1595,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月24日,"I barley come to Stiiizy but when I do come, I get blessed with budtenders that go above and beyond for me! Steve was so energetic and made sure I went home happy with the purchase specially since my order was wrong. He was great!"
1596,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月25日,How do you expect to have customer coming back when you never answer your phone line and when you do it's loud as fuck and can't hear shit . I did an online order never got a confirmation now on my profile it says it was complete ? So why do that when I never picked it up and never got a confirma it was ready
1597,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月18日,"Omg loved this shop. Looks soo nice, and the products are amazing and at a great price. Cheaper than at other dispensaries. Plus on the day I came In they had 20% off on batteries and cartridges. Walked out with 2 half gram stiiizy pods, battery kit and pen keychain for under $100 bucks. My budtender was also super sweet, patient, helpful answering all my questions as I couldn't make up my mind for a few min on which stiiizy pods to get. Line to check in process was also super quick, everyone Is in a great mood. Staff wearing cool face masks, and everyone practicing good social distancing. These pods will last me a while but I will be back once I run out. I already told all my friends about it and they came in and made a visit to the shop themselves."
1598,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月11日,I look forward to applying to this location! My bud tenders there are all so friendly!
1599,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,Pretty disappointed in this company.  I usually go to calma in West Hollywood.  I highly recommend that shop btw.  Anyways I originally purchased the kush stiiizy pen it was decent for the price.  The I purchased two of the grand daddy purp pens and had issues with both of them.   I reached out to stiiizy via email on their website.  I took pics even screen shot my bank account to prove I purchased their product.  But because I didn't have the original receipt they would not do anything for me.  I think it's kinda ludacris who keeps record of the marajuana products they purchase in the first place.   At the very least they could have had me send in the defective device to see if in fact they could fix it.  They offered nothing.  After that experience I really recommend people to look elsewhere.  When you purchase something you do it under the premise that the product is going to work.  Especially with a large company like stiiizy.  You shouldn't have to keep long records in the event their product doesn't work as a consumer we should be able to trust a company to do the right thing.  If their products are defective or I am unhappy in which it works I should receive a new one or a credit for my next purchase.  I highly do not recommend this company.
1600,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月24日,IDE SUGGESTS CHECKING YOUR PRODUCT FOR DEFECTS IN THE PARKING LOTT !! I bought a big stiizy kit 9 days ago . And upon opening my product when I arrive home (2 hours away) . I take my it out the box and put my pod in and long behold the whole inner part with the battery attached effortlessly slipped out. So realizing it's a defected product I call right away and could not get through to any employee only the automated customer service which stated to bring any defected product back to stiizy for a replacement. I was able to finally have the time to take it back to be replaced . The employee told me that he couldn't do anything about it being that it's been EIGHT days and the return policy is SEVEN days . So apparently I was ONE DAY to late to get the product I was looking  so forward to purchasing . Spoke with the head manager and he also refused . I was pretty much done at that point with stiizy. 40$ down the drain for me . . And a customer down the drain for stiizy .I guess some tape will have to do for now so I can at least finish my cartridge.
1601,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月8日,"Stopped by here for the first time not what I expected for all the hype first the girl was not helpful with questions about products considering she works there and I would expected her to answer questions. ( not answer well we just have things this way cause people will come not matter what) No real deals everything they say is on sale example buy 5 for $200 the tax is included in the "" special sale"" on Tuesday pricing so they of course aren't letting stuff go for any real deals big disappointment that the Taxes here are placed on medical patience so they pretty much are exactly the setup as MedMen I would just stick to my regular place on 7th Street much better customer service and first time patients are taken care of there no hidden fees..."
1602,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月2日,"Amazing Spot,Our Budtender Megan is the greatest has knowledge of products and does great upsale.Megan over and beyond for patients Ty Megan. Oh ya the medicine is great too!!!"
1603,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月6日,Love this place! My favorite weed shop in LA great budtenders and they always have good stuff. Last time we got some Frostine from CAM Private reserve...that was good stuff. I've been to other weed spots but prefer Stiiizy when I'm in LA
1604,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月17日,"Horrible customer service, I called explaining that I'm coming from La puente and that I have a cartridge (full gram ) that's not working but I've already smoked half, the girl on the phone said that's fine we'll exchange as long as you have the receipt, tell me why I drove all the way to downtown La from La puente only to tell mr they can't exchange it. I'm pissed you had me waste gas and time even after I called to make sure! I would have taken a half gram as exchange but no that's not an option because I bought a full gram , really fuck you Stiiizy customer service"
1605,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月4日,Picked up Biiit sour straws. The are old and stale! And extremely hard. The sugar is a yellow in color! Very disappointing cause I love coming here! Wont be purchasing these ever again!
1606,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月8日,"Entering this establishment, it felt like I was Alice entering a funky, new age, wonderland that is known for their Vape pod product. There are deals practically everyday for different products. Covid situation it felt very sketchy to put soo many people in one room at one time, regardless on how giant it is. It really did feel like I was about to enter a roller coaster. There is decent amount of parking. One thing for sure is that you can get your personal Stiiizy engraved on-site, which is pretty cool! Budtenders are professional. Solid 4 stars!"
1607,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月4日,So went to this place for first time and they said koo 20%off for first time .. then the bud tender said the whole store was 20 off .. so he started off confusing me !!! Next he was not helpful at all the kid brought 4 different  pre rolls talked about each only to find out two were the same so all he said was bull$h!t then I picked out 2 of the 4 he showed me and when I got home he gave me 2 of the same ones he lied about and most def not The one I picked !!!! Extremely terrible service and so confusing .. just know y'all won't catch me a$$ there again.
1608,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月24日,I was in the LA area and decided to give STIIZY dispensary a try. My boyfriend and I were looking for an edible for my dad (he is a cancer patient) who is experiencing multiple side effects due to his treatment. It is a really nice facility to start off. Our Budtender was Karina. She was super nice and knowledgeable and made our experience that much more pleasant. I came home and my dad being a first timer I started him with one square of the Punch Milk Chocolate 10mg edible. It has definitely made a difference for him. Lastly they have small discounts on certain days so when I'm in the LA area again I'll definitely stop by again.
1609,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月21日,"Amazing store. Amazing products. Legit. The biits are gummies and they are delicious and help a sister sleep. My favorite flavors are watermelon and sour apple. They have many flavors though . I think they  have something  for everyone, depending on your preference. Flower, wax, vape, edibles, clothes, and grinders etc...Me gusta"
1610,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月3日,"Look, everything here I've ever gotten is great and the employees are nice. No complaints on that front. Im well aware this is the epicenter for weed vapes, but I just cannot take the lines and on 4/20 it was a nightmare. Stupidly I didn't just order in advance, but who knew, despite the ""holiday"" and it being 7am, we'd be waiting in line for 3.5 hours just to get in the front door, people were waiting overnight, I feel bad for them. I didn't leave until 10:15am. Considering the amount of employees you have, the relative size of the store and the complete disregard for Covid distancing (but there were mostly masks amongst the crowd but not all, and all employees masked up) I found the wait to be completely unacceptable. Sure, you don't know what the people are going to come in and buy or how long it will take, but we stood outside for three and a half hours. For diddlysquat really, as there wasn't much of a deal to be had that's out of the norm. But anytime I see a line there I make a U Turn and buy elsewhere now. I started to wait in another line on a different date after that fiasco and they wanted to Covid test everyone it seemed, as the line would come to a stop for each person to do a swab at a little table out front, nah, I had my vaccine, let me in. Then the next time I come the day after, no line, no swab, no table. I've seen lines since then but before 4/20 it never was like that in my experience. I will still continue to come here, as most times there is not much of a line at the time I come."
1611,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月18日,"Great place to get your greens, budtenders are always fantastic.  Please make sure you tip them well, they're working hard during a pandemic to get you what you need.However, they're not as committed to Black Lives Matter as they say they are on social media.  The indoor security guard has a thin blue line flag patch on his vest today.  Kinda lame that management would allow that considering everything going on."
1612,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月20日,"This place is awesome , super fancy , super clean, they got security guards everywhere , great prices . The employees are always  chilled and have an awesome attitude  , here they don't make you feel weird. Dear stiizy please post your daily deals on you Instagram, I know the deals vary daily and some deals are not on that chart you guys have up on the screens. I always call before I go just to make sure what I want is on sale, if it's not then I don't go. Please post the deals on your page."
1613,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月17日,This place sucks.  40 min on hold.  They obviously don't care about customers who need medicine
1614,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月7日,All the employees are up to code for Covid they're very clean very fast all wearing masks and gloves. Destiny is very helpful. She showed me so many selections of what kind of strains I was trying to pick out. Very helpful and patient. I picked alien OG. Now one of my favorite places to go.
1615,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月29日,"The wait is horrible, also making you wait in the rain. I won't be coming back here! Rather go to CCC (City Compassionate Caregivers). And it's less of a wait time.!"
1616,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月12日,This medical dispensary will not let you down! Not only are all of their products 100% amazing but the people are nothing but good vibes and informational. And they are an essential business during these trying times that goes out of their way to keep their patients safe. Follow them @stiiizy on all socials. And follow us on YouTube to have access to short and to the point videos about their products. #DoGoodBeGood***please don't forget to tip your bud tenders! The ladies are super knowledgeable and if your gonna tip your food take out or at Starbucks then why wouldn't you tip the ladies that are helping make your day a little brighter.
1617,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月5日,"Love it here! I don't go anywhere else and all the bud tenders are dope af.  Just wished they had a little more variety in tree, but aside from that fav shop!"
1618,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月21日,"Honestly, the best dispensary in LA. Hands down. Top quality product, people who actually care and are familiar with the product and solid price points. GO ASK FOR JOSH. Top tier sales rep who is knowledgeable & also understand what you're looking for and what he can provide you with based on current inventory. WAY better than Medmen."
1619,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月28日,Place is Ok. they Don't Really Carry Any of the Exotic lines like GL420 Diamonds or 5Carat Diamonds. Most of the Stuff here is for Beginner Smokers Really. the Budtender told Me they Were Going to Get Some 5Carats Premiums and Once they do then this Will be a Good Shop!
1620,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月22日,"Very loud, cant hear what the people working there are saying. Way too much products to think clear enough to make up my mind. And to top it off they charge Taxes.  No thanks, I'll just keep going to my local shops. This place is too hyped up. Nothing special here"
1621,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月29日,"I walked in here and I was so amazed it look like I walked into a Macy's,  the staff is friendly and reasonable prices and lots of great flavors"
1622,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月19日,"beware!!! i thought stizzzy was a dispensary not a court house. if u wanna get judged by a bunch of mean girls then this is your place. they wouldnt scan my brothers id because he wasnt up to there standards. jus because my brother has tattoos and looks like a gangster doesn't mean he should be turned away. thats profiling. so we went to jungle boys dispensary, they scanned his card no hassle and got right in! way better vibes than stizzzy."
1623,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月18日,"Awesome fucken products and prices !!! But customer service.... damn its the worst... they offer curbside pickup but do they really? Everytime, every weekend its a problem here, I always put CURBSIDEEE PICKUPPP in description of my order with the color and model of my car so i can make it easier but NO they always make me go tf inside bc whoever is responsible to do the  online orders ( slow ass ) doesn't mention it to the receptionist in front ( other slow girls ), then they say call the store... * me calling store * they give me attitude saying why im calling the store if orders have to be online blah blah blah... i call the damn store to check on flavor availability girllll  since i get a text everytime as well saying there out of that product.... and they still get upset for asking lol..... thanks to security who encouraged me to post this review bc he said this happens all the time. So read the SPECIFICATION NOTES and learn to give out change bc the chick whos usually there for Online orders always gives me more $$"
1624,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月8日,"I drive 2 hours to this store at least twice a month, if that doesn't tell you something. Have been here quite a few times and always have a good experience. I'm that annoying person who likes to know everything and they are so patient with me. The manager Jason was especially helpful in a recent unfortunate situation regarding a mistake on my part. Please bring one to bakersfield so I can give you my moneys more frequently"
1625,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月26日,Was our first time at stizzy & Vanessa was so kind & gave us so much info & help  love the product also
1626,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月12日,"Their rent a cops in the parking lot are ridiculous! Learn how to feel a parking lot, it's not about squeezing cars together so no one can open their damn doors!"
1627,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月30日,"second timer here, love the atmosphere & my budtender noah i. was super patient & informative. he convinced me into buying a king louis XI cart because of the mango flavor, truth be told I don't like mangos though. but he's handsome so I trust his wisdom & it's a tasty cartridge  so I can't complain, 10/10 on my purchase today! thanks stiiizy"
1628,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月2日,Love this place so much!! All the staff is so friendly and it's dog friendly so I always bring my dog and the staff loves her!! They will answer any questions you have. Laura helped me last visit and I was with a friend so I wanted to get a pre roll and she informed me on what kind they had and the price values. Never a disappointment:) oh and the location is perfect right off and on the freeway before downtown!
1629,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月19日,"First of all , the store is so beautiful it's like an art museum inside . I was in awe. The high ceiling makes it feel so spacious . Picked up some pre rolls and vapes. Everything was top quality  . I loveeee the pink vape, the color is so cute and beautiful ! & they look like juuls , makes it very discreet ! They hit pretty hard. You also get 10% off for your first time"
1630,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月7日,"They never answer their phones, forget calling them or ordering online, it's a hassle.  Lines tend to be long, but they go by fast.  I've gotten 2 budtenders before that didn't have knowledge of their own products.  Come on stiiizy, get off the clouds and listen to your customers!"
1631,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月11日,"Very cool shop retail, looks very nice, a lot of artwork, probably the nicest dispensary I've been to. People were very nice and friendly. Aa per the quality of the product, I'm not an expert on that so I cant give an opinion there"
1632,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月20日,Age discrimination at its finest. Hire a upper management employee who put all protocols in place and let them go for no reason other than to use them for their knowledge!! Please do not support a company that is obviously discriminatory!! Please support those that are about inclusion!!!!!!
1633,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月7日,"They don't care about their customers, only about profit. They are not transparent about the quality of their products. Live resin pods taste burnt and aren't potent. Management is kind but completely unhelpful and ultimately don't care about pleasing the customer. I definitely will not be spending my hard earned money here, I'll spend it with KingPen instead. Better pricing and quality. Also when I went in today they were forcing people to stand 2 feet apart with about 49 people inside at a time. Totally unsafe."
1634,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月11日,Johnny(sorry if I misspelled) was super great and informative. She knew just what I was looking for. Great service!
1635,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月25日,Stiiizy is the shit. I love their product and staff. Cant believe they're finally open.Try out their LIIILs or new flower line called LIIIT. Hands down the baddest shop in Cali.
1636,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月2日,Im kinglorenzob  from Pasadena second time there She gets the best education about the product she's kinda and entertaining quick fast pace multitasker top-shelf bartender Stiiizy chose right woman five stars in my book
1637,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月13日,"Poor customer service. I've always been a fan of the brand, but this specific store was a let down. I purchased A product & 30 minutes later returned to store, for an exchange since I wasn't happy with it. Before going in I called & the receptionist said to come in "" well work something out."" After taking a 40 minute drive back to downtown, I was told they couldn't help me. It was rip off, and waste of my time!"
1638,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月18日,"I want to give a shout out to the server by the name Sky. He was so knowledgeable, professional and great customer service. I have 17 plus years in customer service and believe me. It's very rare when I give a 5 star."
1639,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月15日,Check your bag as soon as you walk out!!! I bought a pod and a pre roll. Got home opened the sealed bag they give you and only had the pre roll. So somebody is scamming there in a way that the cameras wouldn't really catch. Can't really complain to them because who is gonna believe me but that's what happened. I mean they hand you a black sealed bag. You get home open it up and surprise missing product. Too bad because I loved the place.
1640,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月27日,"I'm going to tell everyone upfront: Do NOT buy the cheap $7 pre-rolls! I went to light up and while lighting it, I blew out all of the fucking weed onto the ground because it was rolled VERY loosely. They also told me that I couldn't use a credit card to pay for the $60 worth of shit that I purchased, so I'm giving this place a solid 1 star...The other star is for the customer service show that the hot ladies at the check-in desk put on which was phoney as hell, yet cute AF."
1641,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月15日,Love everything about this place. Very well organized and the staff are knowledgeable. Will be back for a second time.
1642,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月3日,I have a valid California ID! It has a crack in it!! A CRACK!!  And I was not allowed to shop!! I have been to stiizy before.. I will for sure not spend another penny on their product nor will I be recommending anyone to any of there locations! And go ahead and give me some stupid response it won't fix me driving 35 miles to your store to spend over a hundred dollars to be denied !! If I was some kid with a broke a$$ ID then maybe I would understand but I am 34 year old person whom is obviously not under age!
1643,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月11日,"I've been to the store a few times pre pandemic but today was my first time going again. Usually I enter the parking lot and get told where to park and I'm in and out of the store super fast and easy but today I didn't even go inside because when I got there the parking attendant was standing around doing nothing and let too many cars into the lot after it was already completely full so I was stuck. Couldn't turn around, couldn't park, couldn't leave.  I don't understand the point of hiring someone to just stand there but I guess? After I finally got to the point where I could leave I still saw him letting people in too. There's better dispensaries with better parking and better employees, do not recommend"
1644,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月19日,"Love this place but Sometimes I feel rushed here. This one budtender gave me another stiiizy reusable bag and I think she saw the other one I already had in my hand, I hope she gave me credit for bringing my bag still. But please let me take my time and browse selection! I'm spending my good money here and I'm a loyal customer. Please and Thank You #staystiiizy"
1645,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月8日,Judy hooked it up!! Picked up some hash bullets and an 8th of true oh! Best dispo in Whittier!
1646,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月17日,"1st timer here! Never smoked weed, never been to a dispensary, etc.I went in clueless and left so EDUCATED!!! Daniela (Dani) was my budtender and she was so genuine, caring, funny and most importantly educational. She really knows her stuff and wanted me to fully understand everything I asked. She recommended similar products and even new ones! Love love love Dani! Great experience for a weed virgin. Definetly will be back and hope to see Dani again"
1647,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月24日,"Giving this place 5 stars just because I love stiiizy and the place was amazing inside and there's a lot of stuff to chose from, not just stiiizy products. I also love knowing I'm getting products that are legit stiiizy brand because there's so many fakes out there. It's a little more pricey here but it's way better than possibly buying a fake cart that might potentially kill you.   Sorry Stiiizy but.....I do want to give my experience from the grand opening though. I got there about 5am and I counted that I was about 20th in line so I knew I was getting a bong. 11am rolls around and I see a group of people rush to the front of the line, mind you security had said no one can leave the line and re-enter and I also knew I was 20th in line. I also see a group that was right behind us walk to the front of the line and now I'm about 50th in line now??? I know there was a lot going on that day but no security stopped all these people from cutting. And then there's even more, this dirtyblonde haired lady grabs her friend from outside and tells him ""shh just tell them you're with media"" and the guy goes ""I don't know what that means but okay!"" And they laugh and he just walks in and cuts everyone. And then there's more!! A group of these girls just walk right to the front and try to cut but someone stopped them thankfully but they didn't go to the back of the line, they just went into the middle part! So a lot of people who were originally the first 100 to get the bong or rig now didn't get it because so many people were aloud to cut or there friends just snuck them in. Stiiizys awesome but that day was just too understaffed with security or something."
1648,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月1日,Honestly? Buying straight from the source without the added extra tax is what brought me in. Fast fwd to actually stepping in and it's a whole vibe. Clean and fast and never any issues with their products...slowly covering my family and friends to ditch their shops and come straight here! Always friendly ppl working.
1649,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月7日,"Good news is they got better at managing pickup orders so it was a super quick and easy process! Bad news is they sold me some BOOF, why are you guys still pushing product from October 2019??? That's not only unhealthy but just morally wrong. I'd give 0 stars if possible."
1650,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月9日,These people don't take debit cards in 2019 and want you to have cash only or use their ATM well I might as will go to the Hood store! Their ATM is not working and they want you to download an app just to pay them called hypur some BS that no one has ever heard THAT CANT VERIFY ME I have walked all the way here only not to be able to complete my purchase because this big ass corporation is ON SOME bullshit I will continue to do as I have already have and continue to support the good stores!! It's a solid no for me!
1651,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月28日,"Selling dry flower that immediately crushes into dust, when asked for simply a fair exchange, claimed that it is against the law to do so, when a recreational dispensary actually is very much allowed by law to do so, but has to pay applicable taxes. Playing down on intelligence of customers is really tacky policy. Overall inexcusable customer service, lol had the nerve to tell me well you saw it before you bought it.. haha can't tell if a product is dry by look. if you want to shop in this type of environment go to Medmen downtown. Don't like either place but at the same price point, at lease they will stand by there products. Left a terrible taste in my mouth, not worth a visit."
1652,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月2日,"THE PORTABLES ARE GOOD QUALITY BUT WILL STOP WORKING AFTER 1-5 DAYS AND THEY WONT GIVE YOU A REFUND.really liked the service from the front desk and the bud tenders- it's always great when they wanna sell you something, but of course when there's an issue you can't expect these companies to act right. 2 weeks ago I got a disposable but within a week of there was 25% oil left and it wouldn't work. When I called and spoke with someone upfront they immediately told me that without a receipt I could not do anything in terms of a refund or even partial refund. I asked to speak with a manager and the manager said that if I bring it in she could give me 5% off and a five dollar credit. In order to get the 5% off I had to return the old one with 25% oil in it. I then paid almost full price minus 5 dollars for a new one. Within one day the battery was dead and once again there was still plenty of hits left. Of course they won't do anything to honor the integrity of their product. Don't buy the portables, you'll get ripped off when they stop working and they won't do anything to help you. Total ripoff. And when you go in with an vs being there to buy something, you get an attitude and the professionalism is out the window. This has left a bad taste in my mouth for the whole brand and thankfully I can spread the word through social media. Business 101 Stiizy- It would actually be MOST cost effective to take care of your customers (especially the ones who come in regularly and buy your crap), than to keep selling crap disposables and screwing them over because you are losing money when people read reviews like this and when people spread the word not to buy your faulty products. If you were proud of your brand you'd say sorry and make it right. Idiots. Smdh.."
1653,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月28日,Probably the best prices on pod refills... some shops charge 5 or 10 dollars more.. most of the time they are fake. Get the real deal. The line is sometimes long but it's worth it.. the inside is huge.. nice and clean its a dope experience.
1654,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月8日,"I have been a stiiizy user for about a year now and i have never had any issues until my last visit. I always buy a 1 gram pod but this last time i went the pod only lasted me a week compared to it usually lasting me at least a month. I smoked it the same amount i always do so it obviously isn't me. I was very disappointed and shocked. Mind you, i don't live in LA so i travel to this specific store just to get a pod and for it to only last me a week was very disappointing. Overall though I deeply love the stiiizy products but i had to share this experience."
1655,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月12日,"F*ck this place and a lazy manager called Silvia. Drive down from Pomona every time to make a trip to ""Stiiizy"" for flower and pods. Today I bought a 1/8th and was short 1.5. I never weigh my product when I get home because I trust the store stiiizy stands behind legit COMPANIES . Called to let them know what was going on and they didn't seem to care , lost one good loyal customer today ! Screw this place. All they care is about money not patients."
1656,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月13日,Jonathan the bud tender was rude. Like he didn't want to be at work and didn't want to help. Stay at home if that's the case.
1657,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月5日,Went there about a week ago the girl that helped me was totally unprofessional and rude. She called me annoying in front of me and her manager because I wanted to use my credit that I had. On top of that she argued with me because I told her she didn't give me back correct change and resulted in me losing 20 bucks. I love the stiiizy products and what they sell but with people like that makes me not want to go back. If stiiizy is reading this and want to reach out to me I know time date and pod so you can track down the rep if you don't Im good either way as I'll be sticking to local shops and save the trip to la
1658,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月13日,"This was my first time visiting the store and I was completely lost on how to choose items for myself and a friend especially with COVID-19 protocols. I was helped by DeAnne and all my worries immediately went away due to how quick and efficient she was while helping me out. DeAnne was very knowledgeable and informative on the products I asked about including recommendations, patient with me when I stopped by the ATM twice and maintained a warm and friendly attitude through our whole interaction. Associates like DeAnne are what will keep me as a customer and I will gladly recommend this store to others thanks to the shopping experience I had with her."
1659,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月24日,"I love this place. Super secure, everyone is friendly and knowledgeable on all their products. It's cash only (they have an atm by the entrance) also they offer special discounts depending on the day you go."
1660,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月2日,"Stiizy is the place to be ..... It's so cool inside plus you get great deals! there is a limit to the amount of products you can by. On tuesday there are deals on the carts, we call it Stiizy tuesday. Their products are amazing"
1661,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月19日,Amazing flowers and products I will deff be back there money is worth being spent here! You will not be disappointed and the store is clean and organized as well.
1662,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月25日,"Easy to find and plenty of parking! Wide range of quality products from edibles, flower, carts, to balms.The chick that helped me (forgot her name, tossed my receipt) was very knowledgeable and friendly. She was patient with me and made sure i got all my needs taken care of.I walked out with some kanha gummies and stiiizy hg cart to get my week started right."
1663,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月3日,"Love this place. Everyone is so nice. But when they run out of product it gets taken down from the website and it doesn't get put back up. I utilize online pickup, so when I went in to pick up my product they had a lot on the shelves that I was trying to find online to put in my order. I could have gotten back in line yes but I use pickup for a reason."
1664,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月21日,I come once a week and love it!! Try the Wyld gummy edibles it you like edibles....the indica ones knock me out and I have the worst insomnia...like not even sleeping pills work for me. Also their Stiiizy pens/batteries (whatever they call them) are the best. I've put one through the washer on accident and it still works!!! They're sleek and instead of screwing in the pods are magnetic so super easy to switch out stativa for indica or just to switch up for variety! Even when there's a line it moves quickly and the space itself is impressive. Prices are fair and the daily deals are very good.
1665,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月24日,"This dispensary is the weed equivalent of TAO in Hollywood, the Bungalow in Santa Monica or the Standard Rooftop on the weekend.  If you live in LA...you know what I mean."
1666,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月19日,"The choice of flower is sufficient and varied. I definitely enjoyed my time today at Stiiizy. Not only did the deals differ it's store from other dispensaries but their bud tenders are knowledgeable not to mention gorgeous, specifically Brittany R. She is unbelievable, knowledge on bud, great recommendations, fantastic customer service, positive stature, and accommodating. You can definitely tell she loves her job and that made my visit fantastic. As shown in photos my selection varied from my gorgeous bud tender recommendations."
1667,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月13日,I love stiiizy there products are so good and their weed products and their prerolls are good.
1668,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月2日,So my last visit to Stiiizy was great Maria helped us and her customer service skills are awesome she explained everything in detail and was just a great person. I really wanted to leave a yelp review and got sidetracked. However todays visit to Stiiizy we got lucky once again and got her as our tender she went above and beyond. Thanks Maria you're awesome love. Hope to see u next time.
1669,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月14日,"Don't use the atm in the Stiiizy store, I checked my bank and more cash had been withdrawn with my account through out the day than I had originally withdrawn plus the atm withdraw fee was tripled because money kept being taken from my account. Overall it's cool on the inside, just bring your own cash beforehand."
1670,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月2日,This place was hella well organized very helpful! And I love the variety they have there! 10/10 shout out Leslie! Supper helpful best experience at a shop ever!
1671,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月20日,Today I went to check out the retails store and it was fun experience. Everyone in the store is very friendly. My bud tender is very knowledgeable about her product. Her name is Ashley V. and you guys should look her up.  Everydays have different discounts.
1672,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月25日,"I'm kind of disappointed. I go to Stiizy at least once every 2 weeks. Today, I ordered 6 items and was told the price of $135 over the phone. Yet, when I got to the store, it was changed to $191. Online orders are so convenient because I am always told the exact price over the phone and asked if I need change. Hopefully this can be explained?"
1673,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月21日,Booooooomb. Stopped before rolling Loud & the budtenders were so helpful in educating & telling me what I should get based on what I was looking for in my experience 10/10 would go back.
1674,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月21日,"Awesome experience over all. Great selection & Stiizy pods are super convenient. Super welcoming & professional, lots of selection. Very friendly staff & plenty of parking!"
1675,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月29日,"Ronny, the head of security, is nothing short of AMAZING. After having ridden my electric board a ways to get here, I was uncomfortable leaving it up front. Ronny was nice enough to let me enter the facility, board in hand, as a one-time courtesy. Very much appreciated, good sir. You're a true gentleman. Will be back soon!"
1676,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月18日,"I love stiiizy !! Straight frm New Jersey . I was lucky enough to be in Los Angeles during the grand opening. I got all my freebies that I was promised and more. I'll be back in LA next year, can't wait to see what new pods they have out by then."
1677,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月28日,Hand Down  this location is amazing!!! The min you walk in you're well greeted by the staff!! Customer service reps are super friendly and helpful!!! Amazing products! Must check them out! STAY STIIIZY
1678,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月14日,"I have made 3 purchases on their website Stiiizy.com and have recieved 2 defective batteries, someone else's order and 2 months of b.s. with no customer service at all. I had to contest one online purchase through my bank, and it now appears I will need to contest the other 2 as well. 1 fraud count was apparently not enough for Stiiizy, they want 3 . Terrible service, janky products. I will be seeking a full refund and purchasing a different brand in the future. The bank will be sure to take action after all this. Forget stiiizy, they aren't worth it."
1679,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月4日,This shop is amazing overall! The crew they have is always so helpful and welcoming!! I would definitely consider visiting them if you're 21+!! Not to mention their deals and shit is fire!!!!!
1680,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月30日,"We decided to stop in after reading the article in the Hollywood Reporter. It is kinda downtown kinda in the arts district but does have parking! Nice staff really nice space! It was not exactly what I thought it would be. It reminded me of a set from Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"".  We enjoyed our time but the really nice woman who waited on us didn't know how to make change. I would tell people to check it out."
1681,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月10日,Stiiizy is the best place to find your needs' the people are super friendly and helpful ! They have the best deals & specials . Always such good vibes here !
1682,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月26日,Everyone here was so darn sweet! I absolutely love this place. They were so personable! Good vibes. Good music. Good people. Brenda at the front desk was awesome too. I was a little disappointed because they said that there was 20% for our first time buyer discount but they only did 10%I still think they're cool though
1683,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月25日,"My clerk or rep Carlos, assisted me in getting what I needed and also aided in helping me pick what could assist me in dealing with my chronic pain. He listened to what I was asking for and also gave his own recommendations on products. It was a plus that he actually has experienced with the products and was able to understand the experience I was looking for. Definitely a store I will frequent and recommend."
1684,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月3日,"Honestly, don't go. I went thinking they're gonna be in stock , I asked for live resin all they had is full grams, then asked for CDT... sameThing she said only full grams. I was forced to buy the last .5G of Lemon Cookies which is nasty (my last choice) and a SATIVA haze for my CDT (I am an Indica guy this was all they had smh ) Wtf why be the flagship store when other shops are more in stock. I drove right to connected cannabis where the prices are the same and they have More selection. All it is is a fancy name brand shop with cute girls in there... that's it other than that save urself the trip n buy stiiizy products from an authorized retailer. I drove from Long Beach and bought nothing, also I tried calling in advance to see if they had what I wanted in stock but they never answer calls, tip for management : hire one person JUST FOR CALLS with all the money you make from overpricing cannabis. Also note to the person who wants to respond to this : I HAVE NO WAY OF REPLYING SO SAVE UR BREATHE I AINT READING UR REPLY #StopCorporatizingWeed"
1685,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月30日,This place is awesome. Justine was great. Clean and nice place. Would come again. Love it.
1686,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月28日,Absolutely Loved this place. Dope environment and best pods are always available. Definately coming back soon.
1687,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月8日,After reading all these reviewed I decided Ill try em a visit let's see how bad it is...Maybe because it was during the beginning of COVID and got long lines and rushed Budtenders BUUUT when I got there it was 10:30am low-key expecting it to be a long line in the parking lot ... nope I walked right it ... walked up the cool Lady with the iPad ready to scan my ID ..she put me in the system she was super chill and friendly ...No I am not a BOT I am your local LB 420 smoker I really wanted to see if it was that bad ... and mainly for a big red stiiizy battery... continuing... She told me I could use my phone inside and for the weekly deals and I walked up in inside and It was beautiful inside and I would say lots of budtenders in like pairs of two all having Conversation all good vibes I walked all the way down got rung up by a chill Guy ..He got me my big red stiiizy and my full blue dream and a gold Battery and not bad not bad ... and walked out and had some hot dogs with bacon... I had a good experience I'll be coming back i don't what these other reviews were talking about ...alr peace ..
1688,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月7日,This is what all dispensaries should strive to be. Stiiizy retail store is changing the game. They have every flavor  in pods a new line of flower and edibles and the daily deals you can't beat definitely will be returning soon!
1689,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月4日,"The place is very nice and clean. The workers are very friendly. However I bought a pod gram size,  and i refilled the pod but the full gram did not fit into the pod. Meaning Stiiizy pods are not grams but sold as grams. I'm wondering if we're getting jacked."
1690,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月9日,"loveeeee it heree! especially Jessica, she was super helpful this morning and made it so easy especially since I forgot to order an item, she made sure I was all taken care of :)"
1691,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月12日,i'm just upset because i spent $300+ at this location and the f**ing budtender sells me weed that was packaged 4 months ago??!! why are you selling wack ass dry ass weed from 4 months ago!!!!???? never again going here
1692,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月28日,"I'm giving a one star on the service not the product. The lady that was assisted us today acted as if we were annoying here, that she didn't want to be at work today. She was wearing a pink mask with brown tattoo on eyebrows. Probably lost them from stressing about helping customers. Her ""B!+鈧琱"" like behavior did not provide a great buying experience. I'm not asking her to kiss the customers a$$, just be assistive in a good mood, you are representing stiiizy after all."
1693,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,Last week I Had a wonderful experience with the budtender named Carlos. He was everything that my husband and I were looking for. He was extremely knowledgeable on all of the products that they had. He  also worked with our budget and found us some fire  flower based on what we wanted to pay!! We are headed back there now.  See you soon Carlos!
1694,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月30日,"Large selection, though you want to make sure to get your product on days that aren't as busy otherwise you're going to get told that a lot of their product is sold out. Order online before you go pick it up, trust me... COVID19 lines are super long, might as well just stand in one line to get your order, than to stand in one line to get in, and then another line to get to a cashier."
1695,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月20日,"Terrible service. The ""manager"" was nice enough until I'm leaving and I check my receipt and she charged me the wrong vape. Twice as much money and she couldn't refund me ! I really wasn't interested in store credit because I live so far away. She couldn't do anything really to fix it. Terrible policy for a mistake she made ! Never coming back."
1696,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月29日,I had high expectations for this store but the person helping me was not friendly and busy talking to her friends. I dropped 200 there so you could do better than one word responses back to me. other workers seemed super nice though.
1697,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月27日,"Came to for a cartridge and edible, was not disappointed, the tender Evelyn y. Was very helpful!"
1698,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月10日,Banana pie live resin is lit . Over the phone pick up is helpful . Line is long . Fuzzies 3 pack wedding crashes are lit .
1699,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月21日,My first time there was so cool ! Jazmin & Jae were so dope ! Very friendly & made it easy for us to shop & get what we wanted definitely going back & looking for them when i go ! Thank you guys !
1700,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月18日,Came in today as a FTP just to find out the bud tender be taught too thanks Karla for the dope experience
1701,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月21日,I was born and raised in Bernal Heights neighborhood and I've been all over the city and I came back to my original boss bought original bar spot and best dispo and they got very helpful employees
1702,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月30日,They don't accept credit cards anymore and they also want you to use this shitty app if you want to use debit card. I'll comeback if they start taking credit cards again like a normal business
1703,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月12日,"Walked in and everyone was very helpful and my bud tender was Kim, very nice and helped me in every way possible. She also let me know of deals and she let me know how I can earn points. Definitely going back"
1704,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月12日,"I come here almost constantly i live 3 mins away. Ive always had ok experiences but the staff almost always disappoint me. They're either too high or chit chatting with other workers that they dont pay attention. Many times my orders have gotten mixed up or i got charged extra on items i did not recieve. When i contacted the store they said theyll have a manager contact me the day of but never did so i went in days later where i was told i could not get my money back but credit, i was obviously upset and when i told the budtender what they said in the front. She went to tell the worker who had messed up my order and they took a long time n got money from the back. I went in recently to go pick up an order ( i used to think the set up back then was bad. Now its worse) and when i nicely told the cashier if she can repeat what she said ( i have a hearing impairment) another cashier came up while clapping her hands being extremely rude. I work in costumer service and i know its hard but stiiizy need to hire qualified employees not girls that are just pretty cause usually those are the gals who rolls their eyes when u ask if u can get another item. I never wrote a bad review anywhere but i had enough with the service provided here."
1705,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月19日,Great service but I feel rushed at time to checkout. I like to observe before I buy. Other then that they are good.
1706,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月29日,"I come here very often and everything is perfectly priced! I absolutely love it, especially the everyday deals! The people here are so nice and always has great attitude i can legit go to any shop thats near but i genuinely love the drive and knowing that they will always have the product i want"
1707,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月26日,"An absolute must! This place is high end and by far the best cannabis store around. They have everything you need and sell all products not just the Stiiizy brand. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly, you don't feel rushed. The atmosphere and decor are on point. Check in and payment are a breeze if you have the Hypur app, if you don't, no worries check in is still painless and they have an atm or you can pay cash. There's plenty of parking, a concern I had being that it's in DTLA. Easy on and off the freeway. Check them out!!"
1708,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月18日,"the place was pretty chill, workers are friendly and you got so many options. Ended up getting some edibles(pink lemonade gummies) and disposables vape, they are amazing, would definitely come back for another visit!!"
1709,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月15日,"They need to work on their curbside pickup, yesterday I waited 90 min for my curbside. I told them i was outside they never came out, i was forced to go inside only to be told they went outside and didn't see me, i think they meant to say that they looked outside hoped i left and didn't bother to text me, even tho I informed then i was outside. I don't bother going in because the budtenders always claim they don't have the product, even tho the booth next to them will, so its a lottery if you get the booth with your desired products. When you try ordering online it says some items are for walking in costumers but even when you go in they dont want to look for it. SoAfter goin in to let them know I've been waiting for over an hr it was obvious they dont bother with their curbside!!! I was forced to go into this little waiting room they have, where they expect you to pay while 30 people walk right behind you half a foot away. No thank you, they need to practice social distancing and get their products organized and if they're going to have products for walk in only they should have employees actually look for them or put them up online. This place is unorganized"
1710,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月19日,Great place to buy the stuff and great staff thank you Kim for helping me out on my first time being there. Looking forward to return :)
1711,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月23日,Way overpriced. Our local shop has better deals on Stiiizy products. Budtenders were extremely slow. There was no actual line or any organization by anyone who worked here. It was literally just a bunch of people crowded around the counter and took almost two hours for me to get any help. The security was rude and kept yelling at people. Really poor experience over all. Never coming back.
1712,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月10日,"What a spectacular store!!! This is the most beautiful place I have ever purchased marijuana. Vik was patient and knowledgeable, and overall it was an awesome experience! The prices are great despite it being such a classy place. You'd think things would be more expensive, but nope! Found some Strawberry Banana Diamonds from Nug that I cannot wait to dab later. Two thumbs up!"
1713,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月23日,"To be honest I really like stiiizy and I buy them whenever the raw gardens are out of stock at the shop I go to., so when I was in DTLA I thought I'd pull up at the actual store and cop one there. The security dudes are nice as hell shout out them they're cool, but MAN the lady at the front with the iPad, she'll either scan your ID or send you to a front desk with a iPad to get signed up. Waiting in the line I had seen her roll her guys or grunt under her breathe at nearly every customer that either didn't under stand what she said the first time (pretty loud in there by the way) or in general was displeased with what the customers were doing for whatever reason. As I got to the front she told the couple in front of me, who were new, to stand behind the people currently at the desk. And when they stood directly behind them like she asked, she rolled her eyes, grunted and pretty rudely pointed to a area to the left of the person she said to stand behind. Don't know why she didn't just say to stand beside them. But hey that's her choice and she clearly was frustrated with people not understanding he obviously confusing instructions. Don't know how she couldn't wrap her brain around it. Then I came up, she told me to do the same, so I stood to the left of them, but also a little back to keep 6 ft away, at which point she now rolled her eyes at me and pointed at the ground. At that point I just walked out. Didn't say nothing but you can't expect people to want to spend money at your business if you can't keep your attitude in check leave that shit at home ain't nobody tryna deal w that . Again the security guards and pretty much every one else was nice. The store also follows the 6ft rule so that's good. Unfournately I'm gonna have to stick to raw garden now."
1714,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月5日,"I love stiiizy as a brand love the pods but when I went to their downtown la store (which is huge) I was very disappointed, I understand they try and help people fast but there wasn't really a line and the bud tenders were kind of rude. They assumed that you already knew what you wanted, and it was my first time there and they don't have an online menu which made it harder. Both budtenders that helped me weren't that helpful didn't really know a lot about the product they just get attractive people to work there and it's sad bc the girl didn't know anything about the strain other then that it was a Sativa and mostly just wanted me to hurry up and pay she had no energy and looked like she wanted to leave. I had kindly asked her if she could pick out a pre roll for me since they had so much and she rolled her eyes as if it was so hard. Sad especially when they promote such a big store. They barely had any half gram pods when it's a flagship store which also says a lot, it is honestly just hype, they have the worst service. I get it the pods are great but that is the only thing they have going for them. Would gladly go to a different dispo."
1715,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月14日,was the spot to go too but no more they did not back up their warranty policyto help my problem which sold me a raw garden refined live resin cartridge in the first place they wanted to sell me a select battery when my raw garden battery works just find...
1716,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月8日,"This place is amazing! You can tell they put a lot of thought into the decor and layout of this store. It is clean and looks incredible. My name is Ashley and I actually had a female named Ashley help me out. She was super sweet and knowledgeable!! I would recommend having her! I appreciate the kind staff and large amount of parking spaces! Overall, it is a great experience coming here."
1717,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月7日,"Great service! Great deals , flower & bomb edibles! Not pricey at all , you walk out with legit bomb products for a descent price! Would definitely recommend! Come check them out! No bunk, straight fire! Even their lowest priced 8ths are & not pricey!"
1718,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月27日,Great service and products. I reccomend paying them a visit and trying out their products. Definitely top quality. Not a big smoker but their CBD/THC eases my anxiety and stress.
1719,stiiizy-yelp,2019年8月30日,Best dispensary in the game! Will definitely be back. Quality products and quality service
1720,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月15日,"Beautiful store!! Very impressive. However, all of the flower on display to view was old and yellow, with little smell. I purchased the Stiizy brand ""Stiizy Cake"" and after I left, looked at the harvest date(10/1/18), over a year ago, and the package date (3/19/2019), several months later. It is now 11/14/19, and the THC levels that were tested has to be lower due to degradation by light. No wonder all of their flower looked old, it was harvested over a year ago, then left to dry/cure for over 5 months before even being packaged for sale. Not to mention it looked as if it had already been kiefed. I also purchased edibles and concentrate. I love the Stiizy pods for their convenience, but they are seriously lacking in the fresh flower department. I can also get Stiizy pods(real) cheaper at my local dispensary. The budtenders could also use a little bit more knowledge of the product they are selling. Overall, great looking retail space, just a little overpriced, and could use a little more attention to detail. Doesn't anyone else notice how old the flower looks? Great selection of edibles, but a lot of edibles and concentrates on display were sold out. Hopefully with the arrival of their live resin pods in December, they will update their stock of fresh flower. Love Stiizy, but trying to offer a little constructive criticism concerning my experience."
1721,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月1日,"such a cool experience. from the store to the staff. everyone was super welcoming. shout out to karina, she was sooo helpful and the nicest babe ever! i came here with my fianc茅 and we had such a fun time. it's so innovative in here too. lots of cool stuff and their merch is dope too!"
1722,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月11日,Stiizy always coming thru.  Thanks to Addy for the heads up on contest. Og kush is my go to. Totally recommend it
1723,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,Christian good customer serviceFriendly vibes when walkingAmazing productAlways have everything I wantShout out to Christian again for helping me out
1724,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月16日,"I've been going to this dispensary ever since I turned 21, I just turned 22 on the 2nd of this month, service is always quick and they're very helpful if you have any questions, they'll always answer. If you take dabs I would recommend their $14 sauce, or even $12 shatter, they got amazing deals!! Can't go wrong with them, half gram pods go for $24 and that's an amazing price!! God bless to whoever reads this!"
1725,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月31日,"probably one of the quickest dispensaries to get in and out of in LA county. budtenders are always friendly and helpful. interior is like a mini DTLA stiiizy so it has the same aesthetic. they constantly have deals and the security is respectful. if you're planning on visiting during the weekend, definitely expect a wait... just like any other place. if you don't know anything about cbd or thc, just watch some youtube videos or read a few articles. don't expect these people to educate you fully on the basics, it's not really their job to teach you."
1726,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月6日,"I have been to this location many times and the overall experience has definitely improved. The male associate at the front desk with glasses and tattoos was very friendly. Tyler was also very attentive and great, he helped me get the Pink Acai which is the best in shop. Thank you for the vibes this visit guys!"
1727,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月4日,Great service and deals always coming home with some goodies to get blasted to XD. Will come again
1728,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月3日,"First visit to a Stiiizy location, pleasantly surprised with a first-time discount and streamlined queue outside and inside the store. Shoutout to Liz who helped me out and recommended a disposable since I'm only in LA for vacation and don't have access to pods back home, but still desperately wanted to try the product. Great value for high quality product ($23 for .5g - with discount)!"
1729,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月31日,"Pomona location always comes thru with the 7 grams for $35 but if you get 14 grams they go for $30 which is not bad at all , less than $5 a G !!  can't beat that none oft the other shops have a deal like that wit the same quality , constant good quality on small nugs , and the service today was great by MELISSA I went after work at 5 . They always have a great selection of the 7gs  , keep u the good work STIIIZY"
1730,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月23日,Place is trash their cartridges leak and they say they'll replace them within seven days if you come back with the receipt but they won't if they've leaked too much. The manager was funny enough to tell me to go to their website and contact customer support. You're better off going someplace else that'll back up their product. There's also never parking and the line wraps around the building while all the budtenders sit around and talk to each other with a line out the door.
1731,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月3日,I love it!!!!!! Been coming in since they opened up in Pomona. Never been disappointed. The tenders are AWESOME and KNOWLEDGEABLE!! Everything is . They are so helpful and so friendly. Very organized and fast...there are reasons you see their line looooooong as FUCKKKKK ..... Sooooo WORTH IT.
1732,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月11日,"As a complete newb to the world of medicinal marijuana, CBD, etc., I was intimidated to ever step foot in a place like this.  My friend, who is more experienced than I, suggested we visit STIIZY, as they have ""experts"" who could help me find anything I'm looking for. Great (I thought).....So, a guy talked to me for a bit and I told him I tore/injured my rotator cuff.  I just needed something to take the pain away, but not put me OUT, you know? He seemed like he was indeed an expert and was like, ""I GOT YOU"". He suggested some gummies as well as some pills.  When I told him I was new to all this, he suggested that I cut the gummies in half, ditto for the pills. I go, ""Oh, the pills are the type you can cut?"" and he assured me they were. Great!I get home, the pills CANNOT be cut. So, I take the first dose.  Felt nothing. 4 hours later, I can't move from my sofa. Lol. I'm not worried about the effects, as I'm not ignorant to the fact that CBD/THC can affect everyone differently. I'm more ticked off that he claimed to be an expert, and got me something that DID put me OUT, as well as assure me something could be microdosed, which COULDN'T.Additionally, I get it, there is some high priced stuff in the store and theft could be an issue (we are in Pomona people).  But like, having to wait in a line, with guards everywhere, not being able to touch anything or read packaging.....not for me.I've only been to one other cannabis store, which was in OC, and I know I was in OC, but like, I could walk around freely, ask questions from different people, and pick up things and read them and such. You won't find that experience here....you won't find me here anymore either."
1733,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,"8/4 4:30pm Front receptionist have such a shitty attitude no enthusiasm for working the front door or professionalism for the company it is, at first I thought maybe I was just overthinking it but as I was walking out they were literally trying to fight a customer right in the front of the store and going outside to literally fight. Definitely won't be going to this location anymore it way to ghettoIt's kind of common sense to have people friendly workers work at a front desk especially in an establishment where people go to spend a good amount of money"
1734,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月29日,"Going here makes me want to quit smoking. There's is allllwayyyyys a huge line outside, and inside, the loudest most obnoxious music, and the budtenders just constantly hanging out having personal conversations. But they will make sure to constantly call eachother on the radio so budtenders know to sporadically yell out 'welcome'. Like I don't need to be welcomed 6 times, just give us what we need and let us go. Always a 40 minute ordeal, here I am- 9am sharp and they've got people standing in the sun, triple digit temps just to preserve the hype of having a line around the building everyday. They don't even have parking, this place SUCKS"
1735,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月7日,shoutout to a new worker named Chelsea! She was really friendly and took her time to answer any questions I had. Definitely enjoyed my experience as a customer.
1736,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月8日,Toni at front desk was amazing! Being it was my first time she was able to give me a really good recommendation. She was very helpful! Definitely going back ! Ask for Toni!
1737,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月8日,Georgee really knew what was right for me. I went based off her recommendations and I couldn't be happier!
1738,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,"My go-to shop for vapes and buds. Great customer service, and lines move fast! Christian has always been really helpful"
1739,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,"My GO 2 Stiiizy shop!! I love it here. Staff is so nice every time I come in. Thanks to Christian for helping me out in the front!! Always great selections too! Super clean, fantastic service, etc!!"
1740,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,"This has been my go to location for awhile now. Christian and Vivian helped me out today they were super friendly and very diligent. This location always has the selections I want and the line goes fast when it's busy. The security is also friendly, professional and I feel at ease with their presence. The store is very clean and they're always having promotions.  Stiizy"
1741,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月2日,"What can I say...STIIIZY is fire. They built a quality brand with a matching quality product. Everything I've had so far tastes so good and hits nice and hard. No complaints on the product, however I did feel rushed in my buying/deciding experience."
1742,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月7日,"Born and raised in California, but left in 2020. I was recently in town for my father's celebration of life and needed a little something to get me through. All the dispeneries that deliver in the i.e. required a Valifornia i.d. I also much prefer to pick my products in a store front. This spot is a well-oiled machine, great newbie deals, very knowledgeable staff, and a nice assortment of products. This will definitely be my go-to when i'm back to visit."
1743,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月15日,this place has made me want to quit smoking. The parking lot is always a mess and the lines are always out the parking lot. The employees are nice but they do pick and choose who to help and they are always having personal conversations on the side. It's frustrating because the line is so long and they are inside talking. I love stiizzy. It's all I smoke but I'm not down to put myself through all the nonsense just to smoke. The 7 day pod policy is really stupid also. The pods are almost always busted. All these negative things combined = me not coming here or buying stiizzys anymore. :(
1744,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月11日,"First and foremost, good customer service. The place can get pretty busy, but the line does move along. Plenty of security, which is good. Discounts are nothing special, but the sale items are a bargain on occasion.For the most part, I have no complaints. This is one of my go-to dispensaries for sure, buuut there's definitely something shady going on in those ATMs. Why do I say that? I've withdrawn counterfeit $20 bills on two occasions already.I don't normally carry cash, but if I do, it's from the ATMs here. How can I be certain? Well, I do monitor my transactions very closely, and all of my recent cash withdrawals came from here. This is really the only place I go to regularly where I need cash, and I always withdraw from these ATMs out of convenience.All in all, it's a nice place and I do recommend checking this place out if you like the Stiiizy brand, but definitely STAY AWAY FROM THE ATMS."
1745,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月21日,"The service is always speedy friendly and helpful... but a solid crew will only take you so far with a quickly declining quality of product. I loved stiiizy... the pods lasted to the end and I felt like I was getting a legit product compared to other brands that would fail before empty. But now the quality has matched the shit of before stiiizy. 7 day return policy is stupid if you go in for two pods and they last a week. If you get into that second one and it's defective- YOURE FUCKED. 7 pods in 7 weeks. THREE defective. Either drooling from the tip or not hitting at all. I know what you're thinking, ""it's your battery"". NOPE, they test it, PLUS I have multiple since I had to determine whether it's the battery or not. Anyway. They took a couple that were defective within the 7 days. But sometimes I get into the second one after 7days. The pods are a shit product and it's really the only thing I went in for. I guess I'll try plug n play? SOMEBODY LET ME KNOW because I'm done going to Pomona for ****42% defective rate. ****"
1746,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月5日,"We asked for our specific strains. All hybrid and indica. The bud tender didn't read back the order before bagging it and when we got to the car we noticed one sativa we didn't order. My husband went straight back in the store to exchange it. Less than 5 minutes after our transaction, with recipt, box still sealed. They treated him like a criminal made him tell the story to 3 different people before finally agreeing that he wasn't a scammer that's done this a million times to them. I was waiting in the car during all this and came in to ask MY HUSBAND if everything was ok. He tried to tell me what happened, even told the girl at the counter he was grateful she was doing the exchange and she got all uppity saying we can't speak to each other! She literally said she would not do our exchange because we tried to talk directly to each other, not her, not anyone else. She started going on about we can't bash her business when no one was around, we were not yelling, and they have music blasting literally all day so no one else could possibly hear us. She was on a huge power trip trying to get us to kiss her ass for doing her job.  KAILEY S. AND MICHAEL A."
1747,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月30日,"their product is not the best as it should be, i asked for th highest thc and when i smoked it it was trash i dont know if theyre mixing other stuff with it to mwke more money ? but im never buying from then again."
1748,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月26日,Friendly service good first time deals!! Fast and easy. No hassle. I'm a edible lover. They had what I needed!!
1749,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月31日,"I am here all the time, lol. Big dispensary with a great selection. I usually get the original pods or edibles. My favorite pod is Blue Burst! The budtenders are nice and knowledgeable. My only complaint is that they blast music way too loud inside, and it is sometimes hard to hear the budtenders. Also, the parking lot is kinda tight and sometimes it is kinda stressful to drive there. I've attached a picture of the pod menu."
1750,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月28日,The dispensary was great awesome staff / prices and selection. Although the security guard turned me off he was wearing some alt right markings - (let's go brandon - blue lives matter - assault rifle hat) which made me a bit uneasy.
1751,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月12日,"It's always a pleasure coming Into Stiiizy. This time around, Tyler helped me. He was very knowledgeable on the vast selection that stiiizy provides. I originally went in to buy 2 black stiiizy bags which would've added up to around $50 for 7 grams. He let me know that they also come in 7 gram bags and I can get two for $60. That's 14 grams for $60! Thank you Tyler. The man."
1752,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,This was my first time visiting this location and the staff were so helpful! I was helped by Amanda S. and she addressed every question I had in regards to what may help me. She showed me the wide variety they had in stock and helped me make the right choice. Thanks Amanda and the staff at this location
1753,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月11日,My bud tender was Elizabeth and she was so nice and helpful with the questions we had. Danielle in the front was very informative and helpful as well. Logan Herrera
1754,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月14日,Had an amazing experience the bud tender Chelsy was super knowledgeable and genuinely was super helpful and friendly. She really made my experience a fun and enjoyable one. Also she had great recommendations!
1755,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月27日,"On three different occasions I've came here before 9:20, waited in line and was sent home before even 9:50, when the hours listed say open til 10pm It's pretty frustrating when you fight looking for parking spaces in their tiny parking structure, wait in line for 30+ mins and are sent home with nothing before the store even closes. Not sure if the employees all just want to leave at a a certain time but having to waste time and gas to leave with nothing is outrageous"
1756,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月25日,This place is like heaven for us adults. Check the daily deals and go on the day of the deal you want. Love their Sunday pod deals.
1757,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月31日,The girl named Mariah was really nice and answered all the questions I had regarding weed. She also asked how I was doing and made me valued as a customer
1758,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月10日,"For being my very first time ,it was an excellent experience.I got what I wanted and Alexis was super helpful and informative about what was best and helpful.I will definitely be returning very soon!!!Thank you stiizy for all of your convenient and fun help.Love the atmosphere !!!!"
1759,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月21日,"Only real complaint is that the parking lot can become a LIVING HELL on weekend nights (Fri-Sun). It's not the usual kind you can circle around when packed, you have to pull back into the street, wait for a light, make a turn back into the lot, then hope to God somebody's leaving. Doesn't help that there's only 25ish spots (and believe me, this place can get packed).Not to mention the braindead morons walking in front of or behind cars that are backing out (I see it happen everytime I come). Rant over. I've never waited in line more than 10 minutes (even when it's wrapped around the building) and they hire folks who do their job with pride. Only complaint is I wish they did stamp cards or deals, or if they do, they're not really promoting them.My go to dispensary.Come on any weekday before 5 and you'll be in and out in less than 5."
1760,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,This is my spot Christian always always being kool and hella polite  and this spot is hella kool with the handicap i have diabetic nerve damage on my legs and it' hurts standing for a long time but the security let me pass the line and let me in hella tight
1761,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月6日,"My friend purchased a bunch of pods because of the weekly deals. But then he opened the last box and it was completely EMPTY. He came back in to get a refund and Stiizy said no because it was over 7 days. This is incredibly poor customer service. What the hell are we to do with an empty box and money wasted? Needless to say, he switched over to Plug n Play. It hits a bit harder than Stiizy and he's pleased with the swirc"
1762,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月12日,"Had one of the worst experiences today. I've been to this location since it first opened, not once have I ever received such disrespectful customer service until today. I walked in and provided my ID as per usual. The gentleman at the main entrance held the door open but suddenly  with a loud tone and the nastiest attitude, the girl in the front counter just told me to wait. I waited, didn't say anything. But then the gentleman opens the door again and when I ask the girl if it's okay- once again with an attitude she respond ""well if he's telling you to then you go!!"". That's when I tell her that it's confusing when one person is saying one thing and the other another. When I asked her politely for her name (I'm keeping my tone and composure)- she just rolled her eyes and said ""yeah I ain't doing this..."" and sat back down. I was in shock- considering all the staff is usually friendly. I went inside, was serviced with the usual employees. The girl in the front desk looked new today she was wearing a red sweater, I've never seen her before. When I walked out, with the most sarcastic attitude she said ""have a GREEAAAATTT daaayyyy"". I continued to thank the other staff and just left the location. This happened around 11:03AM TODAY 7/13/2023. She was the only one working the front desk. I'm considering following up with the BBB."
1763,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月8日,"Had a great experience here. The security, receptionists, and budtenders were all very welcoming. The budtender that helped us at the counter was super friendly and she went above and beyond to make sure they had stock of all the edibles I had inquired about. I bought three different edible products and my total came out to $45.90 which is a fair deal imo. I price compared other dispensaries for the same items on Weedmaps and Stiiizy had the lowest prices. I'm so happy they opened here because there doesn't seem to be any other brick and mortar dispensaries (at least not on Weedmaps) in my area and now Stiiizy is only a few minutes away from me.I asked and there are no first time customer deals, but every time they swipe your card, you accumulate points which you can use toward future purchases.I was very happy with my experience here and will definitely be coming back!"
1764,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月26日,"Tried Weedmart of Walnut before coming here, as it was closer to my hotel. Both had 4.4 stars on Google maps, but I have no clue why. Should have just come here first. Clean, great selection, professional budtenders. The place was busy, but we were in and out in 5 minutes, with more than we planned to buy."
1765,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月27日,Wasted my time   Security guards think their spec ops. Won't be coming back to this location or any other Stiizy. Take your money somewhere else.
1766,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月6日,"This is my local and consistent dispensary. Sometimes they get very busy and other times I'm in-and-out. The flower is good and the prices for flower are great. I don't pick up much outside of flower and haven't had the best quality experience with other items (can't blame Stiizy). If you come here expecting great service- Don't. The people are chill, but some need customer service training. At the end of the day it's a glorified dealer's spot with security, ample parking, good deals and convenient hours."
1767,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月22日,"Just good. Get here. Happy every time. Great deals, customer service is excellent.Safe."
1768,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月26日,First time in a place like this. Very helpful staff and a great product. Tore my tendons in my arm and the oil they recommended was great!
1769,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月8日,The manger working 2/09/23 is the rudest worker. He should get fired and u guys call himA manager
1770,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月27日,"didn't give me my change when i used card, cool place, pretty girls, but give me my money haha"
1771,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月3日,"Usually come here 4 times a week , never usually have an issue nor concern but today our BUDTEBDER ATZIRY Z. Was very rude today , not once did she greet us when she was helping us out . Keep it mind we are there 4 times out of the weeks so we know the vibe . They need to check her or need to speak to her about her attitude against DAILY CUSTOMERS . And if management want to see how she was helping us out they can pull up the cam videos . Time frame : 10:23 am , Order #: pos928205 , register : #14"
1772,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月5日,First and last time I ever come here.They sold me old flower that was 8 months old!!And then I bring the flower back a days later to show them next they ask for a receipt I didn't have it on me and I live 30 min away from this location before I even attempted to go home I asked to speak to the manager just to find out that all sales are final for flower products So what was the point of asking for a receipt just turn around to tell me something completely different they could have easily swapped it out for something else I wasn't even asking for my money back...Waste of time and money.I've been to many different weed spots in my lifetime and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. Purchased uncured weed before from culture cannabis and with out hesitation they helped me out also grass door online delivery has fixed their hick ups and I continue to be a returning customer so big shout out to them for running proper businesses. Anywhere is better than here.
1773,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月28日,Been a loyal customer for years now and it's very upsetting that they block off the parking lot at 9:40.. I get maybe at 9:50 but it's unfair to close 20 min before your listed closing hours. It's two weeks now I need to drive to to catalyst. Your loss stiiizy
1774,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月16日,"This place is great with a wide variety of products. After reading past reviews, some of y'all don't ask the right questions. Also, they have ""No refund or exchange"" policies pretty much at every dispensary I've been to so no surprise there. I will say they don't have the best display of the prices but again, just ask. When I went in my first time I was very overwhelmed and even let the budtender know and they were very understanding. Ever since, I just let them know what I'm looking for and my price range. The budtender every time has had no issue in showing me their products. There's no first time patient deal or stamp card like most places, but the convince of the place itself is worth it. I've gone a few times the past couple of months and plan on going again tomorrow for a pen.So far what I've tried: the Stiiizy brand bud is great, the Select Squeeze THC drops work pretty well and their disposable pens are the best. I also tried some PunchBar cookie edibles and they knocked me out!All in all, I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
1775,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月27日,"All I have to say, from one bud tender to another screw Michael lmao. Go work somewhere else with your messed up attitude. Ruining peoples mood with your messed up mood. Clearly you shouldn't be working here if you have nothing but negative reviews about yourself. Scroll and see for yourself. Learn good customer service or get the hell out of customer service. The world doesn't owe you anything so stop being so rude. I always always tip, regardless of the service. However, this man did not deserve a dime."
1776,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月3日,"After doing a lot of research I figured I'd give this a try after meeting with my doctor. First Time for Everything!  I don't know how MMJ stores are supposed to look, but as a first timer, everything was well organized. The lady at the front counter was friendly.  You show your ID and go inside. Once you go inside,  you stand in line and wait to be called.  Kevin helped me and was very informative. He answered all of my questions and gave good guidance. I felt they were professional, well organized and well stocked. Cash only, no cards. The location is very easy to find."
1777,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月19日,Just bought an *8th* weighed up to a prepackaged 2.3 grams Stop cheating people with this dry ass prepackaged short shit
1778,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,been coming here since this location first opened up & the only shop ive been going to ! always a friendly greeter & budtenders move the line as fast as they can while giving exceptional service !!! cant wait to check out the new oxnard location soon
1779,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,stiizy pomona is amazing!! great prices and customers service as well. everyone is kind and welcoming!! christian is always awesome when you checki in!! spot is great!
1780,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月27日,They close at 10pm but the security guard wouldn't let me in at 9:42pm. Why would you have the security guards cut the line off even before 9:45pm if it says you close at 10pm online?
1781,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月21日,In Pomona but a great location inside.  Security is great and everything is run great in a timely manner.  I feel safe when I go there.  And they have a amazing products:)
1782,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月27日,Friendly knowledgeable ppl. Very fast n efficient Your in n out really quick. I wish they sold ounces in one jar. But over all great place.
1783,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月13日,The weed and prices are great but the lines are ridiculous long ! The owner should get more registerers / make sure all registers are being used .
1784,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月10日,"I've only been to this location twice but I can say the service is always top tier. The person who helped me was very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly & hooked up with a great deal. I felt very taken care of as a customer. They always have what I'm looking for . Not only do I like Stiiizy the brand but coming here is always goes smoothly for me. Definitely coming back again & again. I love being part of the stiiizy family ."
1785,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月12日,Very cool store and the employees are helpful.Make sure you bring cash but they do have an ATM in the lobby in case you forget.
1786,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月11日,"This store is a joke, been coming here for months spent about $500+ on this store only to be told that due to ""company policy"" I can't enter because I don't have a CA ID, but yet my ID was good for you the other times I came to your store......... I'm taking my out of state ID and my business elsewhere."
1787,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月10日,"I drive all the way to Pomona from Monrovia because they have a deal on weed maps that very clearly says ""Monday and Friday 4  full gram pods for $100"" I get there and they said it was a misprint and that the deal ended yesterday like wtf? so you mean false advertising?okkkkkk so I waste an hour of my time driving and an arm in gas. seriously bs, never coming back"
1788,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月5日,Security ken is racist one ask me to empty my pockets when in fact he did ask any one in front of me wtf im a regular here an got treated this way sad that racist people are still racist
1789,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月1日,Some of y'all take this shit too seriously. It's just a weed shop what kind of service are you really looking for? I always leave happy af and love this place 10/10.
1790,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月5日,You all should have some type of a review Calm of the bud you sell there because some of the stuff you sell is not of the quality that is specified we has patience to be able to review these companies that you are selling to the patients
1791,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月25日,Stiiizy really is a great dispensary for me. I dont have a problem in ordering the right strain for my medication here. Staffs are very helpful and kind. Thumbs Up Stiiizy!
1792,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月20日,I used to travel all the way to the LA store just to re'up. I was shock to find out a Pomona location was opening up 10 minutes from my house. The parking is a lot better and they is never more than a few people in line ahead of me which means I never have to wait and the product is always fresh.
1793,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月18日,"Always packed, no online ordering and the parking is AWFUL! The only good thing is the staff, they're all great but aside that this location needs updates like the LA Stiiizy"
1794,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月24日,"I love this location! Been coming since the day it opened, but never had I had a bad experience until 12/17/22 a worker by the name Zach was being so rude to all the customers that were there early, ( probably cause he had to do some work instead of sitting in his car ) and when I tried to get his name he denied and went in the back and hid, I was not trying to make a scene just want you aware of what kind of employee you have representing your company"
1795,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月17日,"These clowns must be making too much money to be turning away Raza ,over scuffed ID's. These fus are to Lazy to punch in digits stop getting high off your own supply and do your job, the crooked ass cops  take my ID how are you clowns gonna be stricter than local ordnance's . Never going back,  use to spend cash up in here  use to tip well ."
1796,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月12日,"Wow, crystal came through big time, I was short one dollar and she saved me!  I always come for the 4g, this store has really nice staff.  Worth all the time and effort.  Thank you again crystal with the cool hair"
1797,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月27日,Amazing customer service I came for my boyfriend and he loved it.We tried there moon pre roll and it was actually good.
1798,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月26日,First time customer and very happy! I found my new spot! Great customer service! Quick easy flowing line. Great deals!
1799,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月30日,"Every product they have is top quality. They have a huge variety of flowers, wax and oils every single store. Mostly all the products are real and authentic. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really love the specials they offer on certain days. They also have amazing deals that allow me to save a lot more money when buying more than one item, which is awesome!"
1800,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月20日,"I bought four stiizy full gram carts last Friday and today on the following Tuesday I tried to return a leaky cart that was burning my mouth & my tongue, but their customer service is horrible and they said no, even though their website clearly states that a leaky cartridge should be replaced without charge. I will not be coming back to this location."
1801,stiiizy-yelp,2023年3月9日,"You must try if you haven't, I always recommend it to friends and family. I've gone to most of stiiizy location from the first LA to the IE to DIEGO to San Francisco. You have to go here"
1802,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月29日,"on merry 4/20 I purchased 7 full grams, 4 were defective but I didn't find out until I opened the 2nd gram, by then when it was past their ""7 day policy"" I came in chill humble wanting the fair solution of exchange, I was brought to speak with some male in glasses (if you are reading this I hope the stiiizys you smoke drip into your mouth) cartridge are leaking outward and downward the wax came out in blobs, this could've been resolved easily bet you would've wanted the same, stiiizy got good advertisement but trash customer service"
1803,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月18日,You spend clinic prices and then they don't want to exchange your stuff when it doesn't work bought 2 full carts and they leak like crazy
1804,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月20日,This Place Is Not The Spot They Don't Help You Here. I Drove All The Way From Cerritos To Come Pick Up A Pod And Some Jeeters They Told Me My Card Was Damage. I Don't Know How If I Can Go To Any Other Shop In California I Have A Valid Ca ID.
1805,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月12日,"Good prices. Deals. Rewards, idk. Pay attention to policy and cash only. ATM inside. ID."
1806,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月7日,You lames are too extra with these IDs....lame ass females in front....Fucking carts suck anyways was just there for some Jeeters...hope you guys get ran out of my city soon!
1807,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月1日,"Stiiizy, although not in the greatest area of Pomona, does a good job at making an acceptably nice presentation.  I went a couple of days before Christmas so, of course, everyone was stocking up on their favorite experience/medication to deal with the holidays.  Still, the line moves very quickly and is very organized.  I think the high degree of coordination keeps the clientele a bit more at ease.  Presentation, outside:  the parking lot is well thought out and there is no trace of trash anywhere (I'm sure the neighbors appreciate that).  I mean, it is clean!  And that attention to detail continues as you enter the building.  Although the main lobby is minimalist, the emphasis is on expediency.  The wait to enter the product area is not very long, especially if you are a returning customer.  All of the sales staff are eager to help you with your selections so that you can be on your way as quickly as possible.  But, this is not at the expense of cutting you short.  They give you plenty of time to ask questions so that you are completely satisfied with your purchase, which makes sense because the policy is no refunds, no returns, no exchanges, so get it right!So yeah, I would recommend STIIIZY for your favorite cannabis purchase."
1808,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月16日,"Love stiiizy, just hate this location. Customer service is shit here. Literally was accused of choosing the wrong product by their ""star employee"". Before I ever got the product in my hands, they charged the wrong pods (I wanted the full gram pod, not the little half gram). I told the guy he grabbed the wrong product and I want the more expensive one. He said he couldn't return the product, (which mind you is right in front of him, he hasn't even bagged it, my receipt or my change). I was accused of lying, so I encouraged them to check their cameras so that they can see they horrible mistake and accusation that's they were making. This employee was obviously not focused and he verified the wrong product and was too ashamed behind his ego to admit he was wrong. However, all of this can be cleared up if store manager Cindy takes time to review her tapes. I will recommend to all my friends within my network to never shop at the new Pomona location, take your business to the Downtown LA location where they always get it right. It would have been nice if Pomona addressed the situation instead of accusing me of lying. One of the managers, after also threatening to view tapes (which to her irony, I completely agreed that she should) finally processed the refund once she realized that it had to be an employee mistake since the customers never even received the product in hand to begin with. Why couldn't she realize this from the beginning? Apparently management falls short, and then the trend just trickles downhill from there. Once again, take the drive to one of the other locations, they in my opinion are all amazing, just not Pomona. Have a great day besties"
1809,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月13日,"This place is definitely now my new go to. I ended up showing up after a coworker mentioned she got a pod I really liked here. I could tell by the parking lot itself that the shop was busy. However the place was huge and they had plenty of staff. So I was talking to a budtender in no time. I don't know what shop those one star reviewers that complained about customer service went to, but it must not be this one. The staff are really friendly and welcoming. One guy even gave me a fist bump and mentioned my members only jacket. The budtender, I unfortunately didn't get her name, was very charismatic and knowledgeable about her craft. I came in looking for a very specific pod I tried only once and really enjoyed. Regrettably the only information I had about it was that it had a slightly fruity smell and was indica dominant. It wasn't an issue though because she knew what i wanted before i was even done describing it. They also, of course, have any Stiizy product you could possibly want. They definitely just got a new regular customer."
1810,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月4日,Usually on point.  Good deals for all the stiizy heads   Everything is usually fire. I prefer jeeter xl so I tend to only get these while there. They do have plenty of options from concentrates to trees. Edibles are so so. Only 100 mg so kind of weak. But that's the law I guess.  Def call if your looking for anything special. And order ahead. Sometimes the line can get wrapped around the building. Especially on pay days.
1811,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月12日,DANIEL Lead Manager working on Feb 13 2023 9:03am needs to be fired !! Plenty of other people willing to do his job better and more politely. On top of being incredibly rude and insulting the paying customer he did not want to show name badge ..... i wonder why! Take your money elsewhere.
1812,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月28日,"Love, love, love this new spot.Where do I start?Parking:  there was ample parking, easy entrance/exit and with security.Staff:  friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  My budtender today was A+Selection:  it's the factory store. They have it all.Atmosphere:  clean AF, wide and spacious, lines to keep everyone safely apart. The defer mural is sublime.Price:  not cheap, but the product is all quality.  I'm a firm believer in the adage, ""you get what you pay for"" and this place is it.  (Bonus points for quoting me the out-the-door price and not surprising me with ridiculous taxes at the register like other spots)This will be my new go-to spot in Pomona for sure.  I'll see y'all next Tuesday lol."
1813,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月7日,"Stay away from this horrible store. I went in to exchange my stiiizy battery that I just bought in July 3, 2021. They said because I bought it at the downtown location they couldn't do it. Ok, no big deal. Not going to LA for a long time so I decide to buy another battery and a sativa and indica pod. the girl gave me wax. I get into my car and realize she gave me wax. I go back into store, already running late, they ask me to re sign in. ok no biggy. The manager Darbo, who was extremely rude tells me she can't exchange it. So I wasted $100 on products I don't wven use. Why would I buy a stiiizy battery and the wax? I wanted pods. I tolex her pods. They're soooo ride and I feel so violated. They also charge hidden fees.  Please, do yourself a favor and go to the small mom and pop dispensary. Not only are they cheaper, but they have an excellent return policy, unlike this horrible mess.   Stay far away from these rip off artists. They're con men."
1814,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月28日,Had purchased a battery from there big starter kit  and did not work . I took back within a week with the box and receipt and the manager declined my refund or exchange  she needs to follow there rules
1815,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月8日,10/10 NOTHING BUT THE BESTOkay I'm only leaving a review because it seems people only leave reviews when it's a bad thing not a bad thing. To the other guy who buys wax instead of a pod  you're just slow ... mom and pop shops/trap shops sure go buy pesticides and question why your ribs hurt  your paying for legit safe stuff here NOTHING HIDDEN. And don't like the prices ? Blame Cali not them it's like that everywhere if you actually go to REAL CA CERTIFIED shops lol why do you think your mom and pop shops change names or switch locations
1816,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月2日,"Had bad anxiety for the first time in my life. Almost a panic attack. Friends and family suggested coming here. From the moment I walked in, it was great energy. The girl who helped me was named Mary Jane. She was sweet, kind, helpful, and informative. I will definitely be back."
1817,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月14日,Shout out to Noemi ! Been smoking a long time but often get overwhelmed with all the options so i rarely try new things but she recommended soo much good stuff i got to try out and step out my comfort zone so thank you ! I'll be back and wait for her cause what SHE SMOKIN IM SMOKIN !
1818,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月23日,"*Speaking for all connoisseur smokers. *They got some good stuff here. 85% of the Staff not so knowledgeable tho.. Probably only had 2-3 legit smart bud tenders in the whole time I've gone (since grand opening. )Best bud tender was some bigger Mexican girl. She def knew all her strains, back crosses, and actually know what a sativa dominate / indica dominate strain.Lastly. She knew what good herb was. Wasn't tryna sell me no boo boo jungle boys or alien labs for the tax tax. S/o to her for making my stiiizy experience the best I've ever had over there. I'll be coming backOverall I recommend the grizzly peaks weed and you must try the lift tickets!!!Please hire people who know about weed industry and not some kids who doesn't even know what you guys have in stock please. Girls are cute and all but they useless if they don't know strains."
1819,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月3日,"Was helped quickly by a guy didn't catch his name but for sure was a cool dude, came in for some pods & was gonna tip him handsomely but he said no thanks & took a 10% tip"
1820,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月18日,Love this place quick in n out !! The nicest employees! Cash only might be inconvenient but is what it is
1821,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月29日,First experience was great. Line a little long but it went smoothly and pretty fast. Very friendly staff would definitely go again. Great prices and awesome deals
1822,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月25日,"I come here weekly, and i always get great service ,Mary Jane was super friendly and helped me with questions I had!"
1823,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月3日,"I was very excited to find a stizzy distributor here in Southern California. The front desk staff was lovely and very polite. However the website which specifically identified the store here in Pomona advertised special deals for the week of July 4th and they refuse to honor any of them and claim they had no inventory however they also refused to take down the ad. Upon asking for a manager I was handed off to a very rude Caucasian man named Daniel who claimed to be the floor manager. He very rudely said I'm out of marathon and said there was nothing I could do about it and probably put his hand in my face and said don't start anything I then ask to speak to the store manager. Kylie came out and I explained to her that this man was rude and threatened me with violence Daniel stood behind her the whole time I asked if he could leave and she refused. I then told Kylie that I had a medical anxiety condition and he was making me very uncomfortable and I was on the verge of a panic attack. You then left finally although Kylie was very helpful she also told me there was nothing she could do to honor any of the specials I doubt I will be back nor will my family or my business partners anytime in the future. I'm closing I would like to again add that the African-American woman with braids was quite beautiful and has a great personality lastly my bud tender Daniella was very polite and very helpful is probably the most skilled employee there I also couldn't help but notice there was a woman with two black braids when I told her how helpful everyone was was she then said thanks that's because we're High, the cannabis industry has come a long way and it's people like floor lead Daniel and the girl w the light complection and 2 long, black braids that give the industry a bad name I hope that they consider re-staffing some of the people."
1824,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月18日,I went to STIIIZY yesterday as a first time patient. The bud tender (Christian) was really nice and helpful. I suffer from Chronic Pain so him taking the time and lecturing me on exactly what edibles I need.
1825,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月7日,"I was surprised to see STIIIZY Pomona pop up on my Weedmaps Thanksgiving Day. My bf and I went as it was the closest and most reputable dispensary in the IE without going all the way out to Fontana. While the area is a littleee sketch, we felt totally safe as there's plenty of security outside and inside. The employees were totally cool and not pushy with sales. Had a great experience there - it was busy but we were in and out pretty fast. Great selection and they have honestly really good sales. Totally worth checking out!"
1826,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月27日,"Coming from a bud smoker this place honestly sucks. Over priced flower honestly. They have good weed here but you gotta pay like $70 an 8th and the weed for less just ain't really worth it. The stiiizy weed is alright for the price, the $33-35 weed usually is better for the price. If you like pods and wax well this place ain't that bad I've noticed the wax and pods here to be the better buy compared to other stores. All in all I would only recommend this place if you are low on time, gas and money. Other wise you might as well go to TLC in Boyle heights cause they have deals somtimes on jungleboys (the jungle boys here is like $80) and you can get it there for $30 on the special"
1827,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月3日,For being a STIIIZY store they have the products you want but my only problem with this place is that that they don't offer the same deals as the downtown stiiizy store .. so it makes me think they are not connected .. why does Pomona only offer deals on Tuesday when the downtown offers the deals everyday.. I will only go to the Pomona store front if I absolutely need to..
1828,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月3日,"It was my first time at this location and it felt like they were just trying to rush me out of the building. The person who helped me, who I can only assume his name is Michael thanks to the receipt, was rude and very short. He didn't care to help me find the right product. Once I asked for what I wanted he instantly said it was out and just stared at me as if I knew what other options there was. I was trying to figure it out and he was no help at all. Will not be coming back to this location for awhile. Almost left without getting anything due to really bad service."
1829,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月18日,"2 weeks ago I had no issues getting in with the same id, today I Got turned away for a small crease on my id same exact id"
1830,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月23日,I liked this store since it's next to home the only issue is the girls in the front. You'd think since they expect tips they'd be more courteous and friendly... nope. Debating returning because of them honestly.
1831,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月29日,I do Cannabis to help my anxieties rarely and this place is very great. The people were friendly and helped me a lot since I had never used a vape form before. The stuff I got was of great quality and the people were very friendly. I would definitely go back if I had time as the prices are not bad and the pods will last you a while depending on how frequently you use them.
1832,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月31日,Very very rude people working here they sold me a empty 1 g jeeter I walked out the store 6 m later I walked back in and told them they sold me a empty jar they would not take product back or exchange it mind you the product was completely sealed aswell as receipt in the bag so basically they robbed me and there was nothing I could do about it
1833,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月23日,Great place. Very nice people. Good prices. Helpful and educated I am looking forward to going back. I bought grape ape baby teeters and enjoyed them
1834,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月8日,I got a fake cannabis oil Vape cartridge.It said honey leaf but I think it had a fake label on the front.
1835,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月10日,"The line is very fast ,10 mins max and weed is ALWAYS affordable, $25 a 1/8th that's very cheap nowadays I try to come to this shop only"
1836,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月20日,I love the Pomona location for us that live on the sgv side. Smaller then Los Angeles with the same amount of variety everyone is always cool here.
1837,stiiizy-yelp,2022年10月16日,"My boyfriend and I have going to stiiizy pomona since they opened and usually get a full gram pod once or twice a month. Today we got our pod, tried hitting it and it wouldn't work. It's not the battery because when I try to hit my old pod the battery lights up but when hitting the new full gram pod it sounded like air and won't light up. I waited till I got home to try another battery to see if that was the issue. Well it wasn't because it's the same issue when trying it on another battery. I called stiiizy and asked when I come to exchange my battery if I will be getting anything for the inconvenience and the girl on the phone straight up said ""no"". Like your gonna sell me a defective pod, make me drive 30 mins back to the store for my exchange and can't even offer a house joint? Sad. Also a few months ago I was sold a pod that leaked wax from the top and it leaked all over my purse. The quality of products are getting worst and customer service is trash."
1838,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月21日,I've been unable to get to the stores. My husband tested positive for Covid. My last trip in I tried the Premium Jack and Skywalker again. The Skywalker is spilling hot oil in my mouth. I'm gonna try different strains next time again.
1839,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月21日,"PLEASE...TURN DOWN THE MUSIC! While we understand the need to come off as hip, I hate having to shout over mainstream mumble rap. Good selection. Jasmine was very helpful but too soft spoken to compete with that sound system. What aims for cool comes off as ratchet."
1840,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月1日,"Just to make sure I wasn't too faded on my last review, I went back yesterday and bought more concentrates and cookies.  My opinion stands, this place rocks.  What this place isn't is the Walmart of weed or a back alley.  You're going to pay for quality.  If you want to save money, don't care too much about quality and only have a dub, head up the street in p-town.  Just bring back-up."
1841,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月17日,They have the worst customer service starting with a very rude security at the door. No more visits for me No sir!
1842,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月4日,"Convenient for the locals, pricing is about the same, daily deals are a joke, never consistent, staff unprofessional besides that products are okay.."
1843,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月25日,"STIIIZY is LIIIT in Pomona. Great music, great art, great cannabis. So proud that Pomona has one of the premiere world famous flagship stores right here in our hometown. Show P-Town some love and support our new first class STIIIZY store."
1844,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月12日,If i could rate this place a 0 i would ! I drove from Anaheim just to get the wrong flavored pods ! The girl ringing me up gave me a flavor i didn't ask for &' when i tried to exchange it w my receipt coming right out from the store they didn't want to unless it was defective! She even repeated the name of the flavor i had asked for . Not my problem they have them mixed up. Definitely not coming back here . Rather drive the extra time to Stizzzy DTLA .
1845,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月12日,"Place keeps getting progressively better, I mean the place was nice before, don't get me wrong, good selection, decent prices, but now they got more"
1846,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月21日,I would never give a bad review unless I meant it let alone write one but I had a numerous of unpleasant visits just because of a few girls that work there giving attitude & being rude. I'm not even expecting for them to be nice I just ask for them to do their job LOL and it seems like they hate it there or something but I definitely think STIIIZY should hire more males it seems like they got drama going on there and I'm definitely not there to deal with that. I spend $1000 every month there and I would hate to stop doing business with STIIIZY because I love their products but I won't be coming back. I don't feel welcomed at all. Like I said I'm not there for people to be nice to me or conversation I just want to be assisted properly get my product & leave.
1847,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月10日,"Last time I walked in they were playing Down in the DM ... it goes down, it go down in the DM. Funny rola AF "
1848,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月21日,I went in for flower and the girl gives me a stizzy cartridge. I go back to exchange not even an hour later and they say they can't do it. What the fuck am I supposed to do with something I don't like?? That's why people go to the illegal dispensary's cause you don't give a fuck about people.
1849,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月24日,Worst store I have ever been too rude security rude front desk people and rude bud tenders who ever runs this insane asylum should be fired immediately. They show no respect and laugh at you when you're having a hard time. I would rather drive 30 mins to riverside then 5 mins to this shithole
1850,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月21日,"The Weed Mecca of Pomona. If you go to this location ask for Raul, not sure if he is the manager, but he needs to be if he isn't. The dude blew me away with his passion, expertise & professionalism. A must-visit for all weed lovers and fellow medicinal patients. If you're going anywhere else, you're fooling yourself. This place offers the best selection, prices and have great daily deals. I checked it out once and this is now my go-to spot. STIIIZY in Pomona, ASK FOR RAUL."
1851,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月10日,"This was my first time at any Stiiizy location and first time at any cannabis dispensary. I came in to purchase edibles and a pre roll for my friends birthday, and I have very little knowledge about weed. The edibles were fine, but upon my friend opening the pre roll, we noticed the seal was already broken and when we opened it there was nothing inside. It was embarrassing because I bought this as a gift. I called the store on 05/07 at 1:46 pm and spoke to an employee and explained the situation. She said I might have received a defective or display item and to come in within 7 days to speak to a manager to receive a replacement. I came in today, 05/11, and spoke to the female manager at the Pomona location. She was extremely unhelpful and told me she could not replace it or refund me because there was residue from Kief inside the tube, which felt like she was insinuating I took the pre roll and was just trying to get another for free. I am not a weed smoker, I came in to buy gifts for other people. She wasn't even listening to me and refused to exchange my item that I paid $21 for. I don't know if this is how your company does business, but this is absolutely ridiculous. I paid for a product that I legitimately did not receive and I am told there is nothing you can do for me. Again, as a first time customer, this is an absolutely terrible experience. Not sure if your employee took the pre roll out before handing me the tube initially, but I will never come back to Stiiizy and will encourage others to do the same. I'll also leave a negative review on other platforms, so other first timers don't have the same experience as I did."
1852,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月13日,"Music is a bit too loud,  you have to yell at the bud tender. Everything else is excellent! Wish they played the games on on the screens!"
1853,stiiizy-yelp,2022年2月1日,"Found my new spot for all my needs and wants. This place has just about whatever you could ever want and pretty damn good prices. The staff is very attentive, I just wish they had a little more product knowledge. But overall,  this is the place you need to check out."
1854,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月21日,"I love this place. I've been to stiizy in riverside but honestly it has never hit like this one has. A lot of good deals here. I just got served by my dude Crumble and I just wanna say that he's amazing. I don't know how much he gets paid but I know it's not enough. Great customer service this guy, he's even better than the girls that have helped me before! Good vibes! Def recommend stiizy and if you ever get the chance I'd definitely recommend Crumble the guy! (:"
1855,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月10日,I've gone to a stizzy for over a year now and I love it. But man this location is not it. I feel unsafe every time I go. The parking is very unorganized and overcrowded at night. A guy tried to fight me over a parking spot. Won't be going to this location or recommending it.
1856,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月19日,Huge selection and plenty of parking. I just wish they included the hefty tax into the Weedmaps prices a $17 pod is really$24 and a $20 8th turns into $30.
1857,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月16日,"Loud, crowded, feels like your in Sephora.  Hard to speak to the vendors. It was really warm inside. Prices are very high with little to offer in deals. Nothing for newcomers."
1858,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月20日,Wouldn't let me in 30 min before closing !?!? Are you kiddin me ? This is how you treat your loyal customers this is a joke
1859,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月25日,"space for great potential, i will have to say it's my 2nd favorite stiiizy store, service was kind and helpful but the music is waaaaaay too loud, you can't hear the employees, also check-in is messy, it's confusing, besides all things it's a good store"
1860,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月10日,Customer service sucked after helping someone out they just continue to talk and talk well there's a long line inside and outside they don't care about there patients time and I personally was waiting more then 15 mins waiting to be attended I would recommend the LA location if possible
1861,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月24日,Ritza the Tender was very helpful with making my first visit a great experience. Good vibes 10/5 will be back!
1862,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月27日,Great store lots of space to get around in the parking lot  plus lots of spots. Inside is huge didnt expect it to be that big. Staff was great i waiting no time at all once i signed in.
1863,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月15日,This store is amazing! The customer service is amazing and I love the products! I definitely recommend this STIIIZY Location.
1864,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月13日,"No stars. Had us waiting in front of their register to pay for 30mins to an hour. 1st item they scanned didnt come up. Some guy from the back acted like it was an inventory problem so he contacted someone. They gave him a barcode to scanned still didn't work. At this point we tried something else. They scanned it didn't work. Finally on the 3rd item they decided to reset their register we were at. It finally took an item. We asked to scan the 1st item they did and it worked. I asked for a discount or some type of help in price. They pretty fuck told us to fuck off. Tried saying it was an inventory problem. I stayed no it wasn't if you guys easily restarted your register I would've been out of here 45 mins ago. No manager or anyone did anything to assist place really shows customer service. I guess just yelling ""WeLcOmE"" when someone comes in is A1 service now and days. Hahahahaha! Way to keep people coming."
1865,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,I'm here almost everyday for my daily needs! They're place is very clean and it has a nice structure to it making it easier for customers to explore their options! Nice location!
1866,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月28日,"30 plus years in the game. Seen the Good, purchased the Bad and toked on the UGLY!!!  Street Vendors, Club Budtenders and granny's Homegrown. STIIIZY merits my continued return because:  I like fast. I like easy. I like good sh*t!!Now, the staff...those that have helped me more than once. I remember their faces and now I got the names:Faith H. ~ ""LOVE"" she gives it and says it! Always offers the use of my credit if any, even if it's only a buck!Taylor E. ~ Lovely, natural RED (HOT!) She may ignite the bud...beware! Just kidding...so kind and accommodating.Jared P. ~ Knowledgeable, on point about any deals or offers...appreciated.Joseph D. ~ There must be a camera in the back, because JD pops up like a Ninja when the line is getting long to help out. I'm usually next (SMILE). Everyone or someone always Welcomes you in, even security is about good customer service. I live in East Oakland. I come here. Enough said...DANKE!"
1867,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月26日,First time customer walked in to buy some cartridges. The sales associate just gave me his favorites. Didn't mind just wanted a hybrid. Was only asked if I had a battery. Once I walked out the store I realized they were pods for their stiizy pens and does not work for universal pens.It was literally less than 5 mins I had to wait for a manager just to tell me no on exchanging it. I had no choice but to buy their branded pen.
1868,stiiizy-yelp,2023年9月4日,Favorite dispensary to go to budtenders always make you feel comfortable looking at strains not feeling rushed. They are extremely friendly and will help you find what your looking for highly recommend! Also are great at giving recommendations on what to try new and preferences!
1869,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月12日,"I will not be back to the store ever! First of all, there is no parking. Second, the place is very empty and the sales people seem like they're selling cars. I went in because one of my eight vape cartridges was not working. They said that I only had one week to return the bad cartridge And needed a receipt. But they offer you a choice of a receipt or no receipt when you purchase your items. I chose no receipt. And paid for it. I went in one week late, so after two weeks, they would not let me return a bad vape cartridge. Bad customer service and no place to park and bad return policies will have the store closed down in no time. Sad to see a dispensary in Alameda not staying long."
1870,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,My bud tender was awesome! He helped me figure out the exact strain that I like. I think his name was Chet. I will be coming back again.
1871,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月29日,Sold me a product telling me it was a different strain then refused to give me a refund. Staff's very disrespectful.
1872,stiiizy-yelp,2022年9月21日,"stiiizy as a brand NEVER AGAIN!! 25% FAILURE rate!The pod idea is great but the product sucks big time. I've bought several different pods different strains & flavors.  When it works it's great, when it doesn't it really sucks.I have all the stiiizy paraphernalia, probably $300-500 worth.  Never again, they don't back their product, can't even get ahold of anyone!  I have no idea which store I've purchased products from.  One stiiizy store says the warranty is only 7 days! WHAT, are you kidding me?  I'don't even know what store I purchase the pod at and I'm supposed to keep the receipt?I have 12 pods with different flavors & strains at various levels of use.  I also have 4 pods that are either new or GT 3/4 full that don't work at all.  When I take it to a store they ask for the receipt and when did I buy it?  How am I supposed to know?  I like 1 so I spend $35-$55 for EACH ONE and now I have 4 TOTALLY BAD pods that don't do $41T!  Talk about a bad product with no backing or backbone from the company.  NEVER AGAIN will I buy a 25% FALURE rate product!"
1873,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月26日,"This place is terrible at customer service iPod a cartridge 10 days ago and it stopped working half way through this cartridge cost me $50 Benjamin, the manager on Tuesday morning refused to make the situation right by replacing my on usable cartridge stating they have a seven day return policy even though other managers have helped me out in the past due to very faulty equipment that Stizzy has now started using as a cheap alternative on like back in the day when the product actually was great. Benjamin is a terrible manager, and the store itself is terrible."
1874,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月17日,"Not only is this the worst weed dispensary I have ever been to but it's also the worst retail store I have ever been to. They don't have a menu, the workers cannot tell you which weed is Indica, which is sativa, which has high THC, low THC... Etc.  I also was not allowed to touch any of the products because Covid and therefore could not analyze them for this information myself. When I asked them how I'm supposed to buy the products they're selling if they can't tell me what they are or any information about any of them they threw up their hands and said, ""Not sure"". I have now had this experience at three of their locations and therefore this seems to be a companywide issue. These guys are a bunch of knuckleheads if you ask me."
1875,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月2日,"I love this place. The staff is always super sweet and helpful. I especially love Faith, she always recommends the best products, and has such a bright and uplifting attitude. Can't stress enough how much I love this dispensary it's the only place I go. The best employees and the best service. All love."
1876,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月7日,"I've had 3 horrible experiences at this dispensary. 1st time they wouldn't even honor the 10% off for first time clients. Second time they were out of the product I wanted and that was advertised (it was a 11 am how can y'all be sold out). This last time was the last straw when they wouldn't honor the 30% discount on the website. This place is a scam, bad deals always out of stock or low on product and customer service is the fucking worst. Try NUG instead."
1877,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月9日,Me and my wife went in to get new pods and our experience with our budtendder was very good. Price were not that high. And he was very nice about our requests. Got some pre rolls and 6 half gram pods and a device pen for less than $180
1878,stiiizy-yelp,2023年7月27日,"Great customer service from an employees!! Good deals through out the month  and the best buds at a good price!! Love the out the door prices, variety's of strains and brands from flower to vape pens. The only club I go to."
1879,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月17日,Love this dispensary. Service is great. Prices are decent. You can find good deals too.
1880,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月28日,"Came here for the deal for Jeeters, mess up my order and didn't give me the deals for my 1G, employee just be super high in there, take order super slow not even on point that what customer wanted. Remember to check your order because they don't do any refunds or they will scam you!!!"
1881,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月2日,Christian was extremely professional and helped me pick out exactly what I didn't know I wanted! Thank you and I'll be back to shop with you again
1882,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月27日,"Dang now I have to sadly update this awesome review and knock down more than 1/2 the rating due to the most recent interactions with the staff.Yes the deals are to die for, who doesn't want low priced THC with today's inflation? But how can I support this business when the staff is hit or miss on customer service and policy. It's actually very disappointing to be turned away after 3 months of consistently coming here. Another time where I was looking forward to purchase, the associate kept offering items that I told him I did not want and he wasn't trying to help me at all. I told him my budget and what category I was looking for. He went well above the budget and not even what I was asking for so he clearly was just trying to get some brownie points. Well here's my constructive criticism:Make sure all staff follows policy and not just 5% of the time. It makes the consumer (me) believe you guys do whatever you want and for certain customers you don't bend the rules. That's BULLSHITAlso, if the consumer is specifically stating their budget that doesn't mean there's a window of 0-100 from that budget. Please be respectful and kind as we are literally paying this business to be open."
1883,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月14日,Cheap Carts cuz they mostly defective and they give u a hard time when u try to exchange.  I've spend thousands of $s here and they would not replace a $20 cart.  The manager Rich or Richard or just plain Dick is a real A hole.
1884,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月12日,"Terrible customer service! Make sure you check the packaging dates on your items. Bought a cartridge and checked the packaging date when I literally walked out the door, and noticed it was two years old. Went right back into the store to return it, they wouldn't accept it. Asked to exchange it, wouldn't do it. Been going here since they opened. I will be taking my business down the street to Embarc from now on."
1885,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月18日,This store sucks ass they never answer calls always bad customer service they can not help anybody for shyt can't even touch the yard or smell the product  not a good store to go to
1886,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月4日,"Stizzy taste all the same, used to be hyped on a new flavor till they came out the same. The design itself sucks on the battery because if you drop it it flys into the backrooms, olug n play brand is better tho frfr"
1887,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月3日,Don't buy the disposable vape pens! I brought 2 and they got clogged up after just a few uses. I tried everything to clean them out but they were clogged up with resin. Other than that I liked the store but I don't think I will go back. It was a huge waste of money.
1888,stiiizy-yelp,2023年5月14日,Big thanks to Stiiizy for the best customer service offered. Love the great ambience your dispensary gives to clients like me. Keep up the good work.!
1889,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月10日,Great service good vibes love the neighborhood also ate around the area great food as well
1890,stiiizy-yelp,2022年8月7日,"So it's been a minute since my last review and in fact I had written up a follow up not long after only to kinda get scared after a few calls.So after the being told I could come in I tried calling to talk to a manager only to get no response, my sister helped and gave called from her phone but still no answer she then called from her work (a hospital) and they answered almost immediately but where kinda taken a back when she asked for a manager.She only gave them her number to call back not my name or my number.She was told they would call her back... it's been 11 months now still waiting, doubt the guy she spoke to even took down her number.About a week later I started getting phone call from numbers I don't recognize so I don't answer them.One day on a whim I decided to answer it and holy crap it was them, the same girl from the counter not even a manager.Before any introduction she starts questioning me if I've recently left a review somewhere harassing them.I just said no, not really wanting to make amends at that point, she then tells me they're calling people who match the name on my profile.Seriously creepy, how many other people with the same first name and last initial did you call before me?my anxiety rose through the roof that I tried to delete my review(only deleted to follow up) and abandoned this account.Like they got my number off of their files pretty sure they got my address and don't live that far from them, so you can see how this would have freaked me out.Oh an still haven't gotten a new ID and I'm Still welcome at every other dispensary in the bay shit even Portland."
1891,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月12日,"Its the same thing everyone else has been saying.   Mediocre bud. They're continue to raise their prices, which is astounding to me since its already high. Pre-rolls are inconsistent.   Four-five cash registers, but always only two open, and with the amount of typing they do on it you would think you were logging in to the CIA mainframe (so expect a wait). Literally they have like five workers hustling around like they're doing something important with only 2/3 registers going.   All you need to know about the Owner's ethics of this place, aside from their price raising, is their response to the reviews on this page. If you place a positive review, they say ""come on in and show this review and get a 1$ pre-roll,"" post a negative review and they give you the typical ""hey give us a call to talk about it."" I don't want to talk about it. I want a pre-roll if it says a ""1g,"" to be ""1g,"" and I expect not an increase in price for the same bud as last week.   This place is like all the other places in the Bay (which is terrible for weed purchase to begin with like everything else in the Bay) they start out cheap to pull everyone in and then jack up the price. Be ready to find a new spot soon folks.   Just go and see. Don't believe, just go and see."
1892,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月5日,"This joint (there's going to be a lot of puns in this review, just FYI) was desperately needed. Tired of getting taxed to death at other dispensaries or coming home and opening the package only to find pot potpourri? (I told you I would abuse the practice of pun in this one...) Just go to the STIIIZ' y'all! It's affordable, they have quality products and the staff are all helpful and friendly. I was surprised to find how many products were so much less expensive than other clubs. On top of that, their daily deals are actually good daily deals--instead of those $1 dry ass pre-rolls made from shake older than the Latin language offers. To be blunt, (alright, that's the last one, promise) I don't have to bother going anywhere else as long as STIIIZY stays as consistent as they have been."
1893,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月16日,"Date: 2/15/2020  Time: 5:00 PM  54掳  Mostly sunnyHusband and I have been waiting since last year for Main Street Supply to open. A friendly neighbor of ours gave us some edible gummies from them. Thus, we stopped in to check out what they had available.We love Harborside on Embarcadero in Oakland, but Main Street Supply is closer to home. They are located on the corner of Webster & Haight, which is about 6 blocks and within walking distance from home.Before entering premises, we have to show a valid CDL  and a CID to the person in the lobby. There is also a security guard standing nearby. Photos of our CDL/CID are taken for uploading along with our telephone number into their system.This site used to be Financial Benefits Credit Union. I was able to take care of some of my transactions with them. It was also very convenient to use their ATM machine. They're gone. In its place is this cannabis club.Ambiance: Nice, clean and well lit. Merchandise items are well organized on shelves. They have edibles (gummies, brownies, etc.) and cannabis oils stored in the glass display cases. Customer service: friendly, helpful and well-informed. Professional staff. There is also a binder with an inventory list of available products for review by customers.Drawback: It's minor. Street parking can be problematic. However, there is a parking lot across the street on the Haight Street side. Tip: Do not use the parking lot during the day from about 8 AM to 2 PM on Tuesday and Saturday. Those two days are for Farmer's Market. Vendors are on Haight Street and half of the parking lot. Currently they are offering 25% off their items until the end of February.Return visit: Yes, my husband uses the Papa Barkley cannabis oil for his aching joints. I am interested in the blackberry gummies."
1894,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月4日,"I've been frequenting Main St. since they opened. It's amazing in there and the staff is very knowledgeable. Story time: I purchased 4 containers of Stiiizy gummies this day, and when I got home I noticed 3 out of the 4 containers were manufactured were more recently. Not 4/08/20. So, I didn't think it would be a problem to take my unopened container back the same day and ask to exchange it for a more current manufactured date. Why not? I waited in line, went inside, and talked to the salesperson. Told them about the situation and was told that they couldn't do anything for me. So, I had to keep the container. I didn't want money back, I just wanted to exchange it for a ""fresher"" container. Simple. What a bummer..."
1895,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月5日,I was a regular customer here for two years and when I tried to return a defective cartridge (tried on two fully charged pens at home) they refused to take it back. It was within 7 days with a receipt. The manager was very rude and unhelpful. Instead of a simple exchange she chose to humiliate me in front of everyone in the store. There are several other dispensaries and delivery services so no need to go to this low quality place. They barely have any selection these days anyways. Sorry to all the people that work there who I always tip generously that I will not be back.
1896,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月13日,Some staff members need to lighten up and not put down there customers I said what I said if you want details hmu       **your getting 3 stars because this the only place that got my shxt.
1897,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月7日,Been coming here a long time but I have been noticing the carts are getting bad. They always clog and then the wax starts leaking out into your mouth and leaving nasty taste for awhile. There's a couple cool people in there like the red head. Good prices but idk starting to second guess coming here
1898,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月30日,"Great service, professional staff that are very knowledgeable about the different products. They provided different options for me when I was super indecisive on what I wanted or was looking for. Main Street Supply is a very clean and a newer facility. Love the modern look. They're admitting only a few people at a time, try not to lean over the counter to protect yourself and the staff. Would come here again!"
1899,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月26日,"Not the biggest fan of this shop. Friendly service by staff but product is not the best, year old edibles are being sold for full price. Also no prices are listed in shop, comes off a tad shady. Better shops with more transparency are available in the area."
1900,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月29日,"m only giving them 2 stars because although the customer service is in fact good, they say they close at 9 on maps, but you get there even 10 minutes before and claim they close at 8:45 And not to mention half the battery packs i have bought from them malfunction within the first week of buying them..."
1901,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月27日,"We stop by here last weekend for the second time. They have a much better selection of per-rolls & flower. Lots of stiiizy products and a decent supply of edibles. Friendly & helpful staff, they do not accept credit cards but has two ATM machines inside and one outside.  They are open during the COVID-19 and the security guard out front will ask to see your license and have you remove your mask to make sure you match the picture on your ID. Once confirmed, you can put your mask back on before entering."
1902,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月20日,"First time into this place yesterday. Started off weird right off the bat... security guard tries to hustle vape pens and cartridges to us at a super gouged price! $80!? What in the funk? So that was before we even walked in the door.. then we get checked in by the lady at the desk. Told her it's our first time here... no special deals were offered.. they didnt let me know about any upcoming specials or happy hours or really any information regarding the business like a normal shop would if you told them it was your first time. Then onto the experience... I dealt with Sam.... Sam was nice... however it felt like she was semi rushed and didnt really have any knowledge regarding the product they sell... it seems like more of a ""let's hire some cute girls"" type of place instead of hiring knowledgable bud tenders. So after her showing me 3 diff kinds I selected a couple different strains I preferred and she bagged me up... I paid and that was it for the experience. I wasn't able to look at the buds or the info on the jars until I left the store. Not sure if this is standard policy, but it all felt very rushed. Then .. I get home... open my bag and look at the jars... harvested in DECEMBER!? For both jars that were two different brands? Its June ! 6 month old buds still on your shelf? That's a sign of a club that doesnt move a lot of product. Now onto the actual buds I received. I was less than thrilled to receive old buds that were harvested 6 months prior and dried out. Additionally if you are looking for any deals on shrubs in the bay, good luck! The taxes in the Bay area are some of the worst in the state. I would recommend traveling elsewhere to shell out your hard earned cash."
1903,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月9日,"Good place to buy, no tax and service is great!!I love this place when I'm in alameda"
1904,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月30日,"Clean, professional, and great prices! All of the workers are friendly and knowledgeable. They also take COVID safety very seriously, they take your temperature at the door and have markers to direct you on where to stand. I can't say enough about the prices though, I got 3 packs of edibles and a bottom shelf pre roll for only $58 total, such a good deal! Can't wait to come back!"
1905,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月10日,"Friendly Aye it's gas 9/10, hey j always runnin low on the blunts and the polo carts other than that dope af"
1906,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月10日,Came into Alameda for a couple of days and this spot is CLUTCH! Great staff and nice selection! Thank you for all you guys & gals help!
1907,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月16日,"I've been to a huge amount of cannabis dispensaries in the Bay Area and 'every one of them, besides this one' does a 10%-20% military discount to support myself and our military veterans. Especially, disabled military veterans like myself. This place was rude to me after asking if they took military discount and they don't offer any type of discount whatsoever for us. Also, the people that work there are kids messing around and acting like children with have attitude problems right when you walk in the door. Very unprofessional environment. Please don't support this store, since they are not supporting us Veterans. Pretty ridiculous. Greed to the fullest, even though these dispensaries are already extremely overpriced and making all kinds of money from us. No need to be the greedy Stiizy. So many other cannabis clubs to go to that will treat you right, give you a better deal, and support our US veterans."
1908,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月21日,"The employees need to be better trained on how they talk to customers. These ugly ass girls behind the register needs to stop acting like the own the mf store, an be more respectful to customers cuz next time I came in there any mf that give me a dirty look I'm turning that b*** up"
1909,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月31日,"Friendly staff, first time discount and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back. Thank you"
1910,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月17日,"Visited the store to buy some flower in late November after reading good reviews. My in-store experience was positive with the budtender (guy named Chris?), and he helped me select a nice 1/8 for $50. As I was leaving, I asked to see the vape cartridges because my wife was almost finished with hers. He sold me a product by Honeyleaf (AVOID AVOID) for $40. I threw in an $8 tip, and figured it was a good day.Fast-forward three weeks. The flower turned out to be so-so, but that's nothing against them. However the vape cartridge was out and out broken. The tip at the bottom fell right out and wouldn't go into a battery. I figured they were so nice the first time around, wouldn't they be able to help me? Clearly it was their fault for selling a bad cartridge.This time the friendly budtender was not there but instead a woman who only glanced at the package (see photo), and didn't even look at the cartridge. She said, ""For that product in particular, we only have a 7 day guarantee. We print it on the receipt. Sorry. ""For THAT PRODUCT. So, they knew Honeyleaf was a dodgy brand and even warned you ON THE RECEIPT, but you would have to examine the receipt to know this. Friendly guy Chris never mentioned this. Thanks, dude! Want to give me back my $8?I thought I could salvage the situation by transferring the oil to another cartridge, but it gets better! Honeyleaf must use permanent glue on the mouthpiece, because no matter how I tried I couldn't remove it to access the liquid, and eventually it broke.So net... Honeyleaf sells bad product. Never even got to taste the vape since the package was unusable.Main Street Supply knowingly sells bad product, doesn't guarantee it, and doesn't warn you if you are buying bad product.There are plenty of great dispensaries in the Bay Area--please go to those instead! And don't bother repsonding, ""Business Owner."" I will not accept a measly $1 coupon when you bilked me out of $40. I would prefer to see you close shop and be replaced by someone with ethics."
1911,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月12日,"I was greeted by a secruity guard & had the front desk check me in. They took a photo of my I.D. They later asked for my phone number & lead me to the store. The store reminds me of an apple store. They have a lot of display cases of cannabis products & big flashy TV monitors to advertise their products. They also have a merchandise section for clothes, bongs, & lighters. I really like how spacious the store is, so i can walk around freely without bumping into people. However the store feels pretty empty. They have brands like NUG, Fun Uncle, Select, King Pin & Etc. Theres budtenders who are friendly & sweet. They have a 25% off deal for till the end of feb. Overall this dispensary seems very clean & professional."
1912,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月31日,Don't listen to their business hours apparently they close at 8:45. I came here at 8:50 and they turned me away. Piss poor service if you ask me
1913,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月12日,Nathan was very knowledgeable with the products I was looking for. Very professional and nice. The place is very clean and welcoming. You have to check in before you enter the floor.
1914,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月8日,"First of all, me and my boyfriend went inside for his first time and I was excited to show him because I come here pretty often. There's a girl with bad eyeshadow showing us pre-rolls and she drops everything in the case and won't stop laughing about it. She was so obsessed with the fact she dropped everything she kept ignoring us to tell her co-workers the thing she just did and they didn't even find it that funny. A bunch of ""sorry, what did you say"" and then when we left the dispensary my boyfriend noticed his Stizzy pod was over a year old, manufactured 6/2020 and it literally says on their website their pods only last a year DEPENDING on how it was taken care of. So my boyfriend went in first to tell them, and they denied him any exchange or refund because it's not considered ""defective"". So I stepped in and I told them, expired pods IS defective. It LITERALLY says on their website and I was told no by multiple people including their manager until they talked to their higher up and they were happy to exchange the pod after a long time of arguing with them. Entitled people working here need to get over themselves."
1915,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月5日,"Last month I visited the STIIIZY store in Alameda and I felt like a kid in the candy store. There were lots of options to choice from, friendly bud tenders, and good deals for first patients. I ended up purchasing a stiiizy battery, 2 cartridges, and some flowers. I read some reviews about the battery and there were a few ppl who said it stopped working or that they had issues with it. I decided to get the newest stronger battery in hopes that I didn't have that problem. Unfortunately I did, and and the club only offers a 7 DAY RETURN POLICY. That's not even enough to test the product. I was then told I could reach out to the website to ""possibly get a replacement"". It sucks that you can't go to the Stiiizy store for a Stiiizy but I definitely recommend sticking to flowers and edibles if you don't want to waste money."
1916,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月10日,"I love this place. Everytime I come here im I'm so happy because of the A1 service I recieve everytime plus not too mention the great deals. If Hana is there best believe you're in good hands shes so friendly and welcoming, just really wanted to give her a shout out because shes so awsome, thanks girl."
1917,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月28日,"Love this place! So glad to have a dispensary of this pedigree in Alameda. They are very detail oriented in maintaining COVID protocol & the staff/security are all extremely professional & cordial. It's clean, modern, spacious & well-organized. I really appreciate their Stiiizy battery/pod recycling program as well!"
1918,stiiizy-yelp,2022年6月20日,I had an issue with a pod that I purchased that wasn't working and they got me a new pod replacement right away after looking me up in there system. My experience there was some of the best customer service that I've had in a long time. And believe me I have high expectations when it comes to customer service. Hannah the manager at this location definitely over exceeded every bit of my expectations when it came to her customer service. She was awesome!!!
1919,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月19日,Cheap quality . I paid $250 and got some small bud shit that is not good and makes me cough..I asked the sales guy to give me top shelf and he gave me some bad shit ...
1920,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月1日,"As a regular customer here, I'm truly satisfied with the customer service and their support team. They are quick and efficient when it comes to providing 100% customer satisfaction. I highly recommend checking out this dispensary for their wide variety of options! Special shout out to Sam, Nathan, and Kelsey!"
1921,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月4日,If I could give zero stars I would first I called to get correct information about a deal that you guys are doing and all the reception is tells me is oh I don't know so I asked him politely to get up and go ask the Bud tender and he literally did not want to so I ask for the manager I talk to the manager all the manager tells me is I was rude for calling the receptionist lazy for not wanting to check for me and then I said I'm not being rude he's being lazy what kind of customer service is this and nothing he hangs up on me.. So then to test the theory I had my boyfriend call and ask the same exact questions and do you guys do you have the deal he told me the strains and that prove that the receptionist is lazy and he's a liar
1922,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月7日,"Smooth process as a first timer. Good music, staff was pleasant, quick transaction and the set up is reeeaal nice. If they weren't cash only I wouldve spent more. So maybe that's a good thing lol"
1923,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月3日,"****TLDR? Friendly, helpful staff and amazing selection and nice deals especially around holidays!Went in for the first time the other day and was super impressed! Beautiful store with super helpful and very pleasant staff. Melvin was super helpful and sweet. We were fortunate enough to have come in while their Halloween Specials were in effect and got amazing deals on the cartridges we were in need of. Flower was on special, too, so we took advantage of the awesome 1/2 ounce deal, too! Alexis at the front desk was super friendly and helpful answering our questions. We will most definitely be back again soon."
1924,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月30日,"been coming here for years and the employees are always super chill, know what you want when you get there. stay blessed...and high"
1925,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月8日,"Nice enough people work there but there is no menu and no prices posted anywhere.  If you are looking for a specific strain, good luck.  Their hours say they close at 9 pm but I got there at 845 and was turned away by the security guard who told me that their 'system was down'. What system, this place is cash only. Turned away, smokeless, dammit! This and no menu or posted prices make me wary of this place.  I'll just go to Harborside, it's actually closer to me."
1926,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月20日,"Great club in alameda. Staff is super nice - only downside is they only had 2 checkout machines so people get their orders and then you might have to wait while the order in front of you finishes selection + checkout. If possible, I wish it was more clear the pricing / quality of the flower. It's a little time consuming to ask for all the sativa flowers they have in stock and then go through pricing individually. Would be helpful if they organize it by top/mid/bottom shelf so people have a good starting point based on how much they want to spend."
1927,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月19日,"Solid cannabis shop overall that I'm happy has joined Alameda. Competitive prices, especially with their extended store opening discount. Staff is friendly, supply seems varied, and the store is clean and discreet. I appreciate that it aesthetically adds to the Alameda community. These guys lost a star for two reasons: 1- I know this is trivial, but does your ""we are open"" sign need to take up half the sidewalk? No one else is doing it. 2-Less trivial, why can't you clearly display prices for your goods? I hate having to ask every time, it's a waste of time and makes me feel weird constantly asking how much each item costs. Can't you just put out little placards next to each product listing the price?"
1928,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月16日,My husband went in to grab some tree last week for the first time. It was fire and he said he got it for a kool price. We normally get our trees from Oakland but they charge hella tax. 3 different tax to be exact!! Today was my first day going to STIIZY Alameda with my husband. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. Especially the young lady at the front desk. They have great QUALITY products and the best LOW prices. I recommend everyone go there at least once and see for yourself.
1929,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月23日,ALL the flavors on this store it's the best in the Bay Area for getting your stiizy IF your looking for one come to this place man all the flavors and no over price . They also have the best pre rolls I would be back every weeken
1930,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月8日,New dispensary in Alameda first time visiting and was impressed with the inventory. (Flower Pre-rolIs) I like variety and MSS did not disappoint now let's see if they can be consistent definitely going back for seconds.
1931,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月2日,As good as the pricing this place has their customer service absolutely sucks. I was at the door at 8:44 PM and they would not let me go in. On yelp and on weed maps it states that the place closes at nine and the young lady inside told me that they close their doors at 8:45 to allow the people inside to purchase which is dumb because how would Anyone know this information if it's the specific time is not posted anywhere. I traveled all the way from Richmond and no one would let me go in and the security guard was rude. This place as good as their prices are sucks in hospitality. If I can give them 0 stars I totally would.
1932,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月10日,Staff is dope I appreciate the covid safety. Selection is great prices are cool . Kinda looks like an Apple store just better because they have trees.
1933,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月21日,"I love the painted exterior building with the large green cross. The inside is modern but small and too much of the store is dedicated to t-shirts, hats, and other accessories. The product offerings for me -- tinctures and other products to help with sleep -- are limited. I was happy to find Care By Design but they didn't have a 1:1 tincture. Same with Papa & Barkley. The guy who helped me was sweet but wasn't familiar with products that are relevant for me. Plus, the month-long 25% discount just barely made them competitive with Harborside and Magnolia but once that discount's gone...;-( I love that Alameda finally has a dispensary but I'm still going to cross the bridge for a better product selection (Harborside) or knowledgeable staff (Magnolia)."
1934,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月16日,Great quick service! Great products. First time here. Will definitely come back. All the products are fire and the employees know what they're talking about.
1935,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月27日,Nothing good here they selling out of everything good so they can be a stizzy only retailer..... Go to Nug Wellness if you want some fire products and good selection at that I've been back to this dispensary time after time month after month and them being sold out of the same things is pretty disappointing being a local alameda resident this was total convenience but now it's inconvenient having to go out of my way to go to another club out of alameda for better products but it's alright.... I'm cool off the 1$ outdoor shake preroll they try to give you to win there business back too
1936,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月29日,Main Street Supply is exactly that. Everything you need. Amazing selection and even better staff. Treat you right. Definitely check this place out. We are so glad you are in the neighborhood!  Support this business. There is something here for everyone!Rock on from Da Slomo!!
1937,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月28日,Wow! Worst product ever handed to customers in main street's recycled black garbage bags. The workers basically take your money and throw out the garbage by handing you garbage weed in your new garbage bag. Oh and you cant return with thw bag you purchased last to save the world. Nah COVID... But money and Covid arent the same. All drug dealers the same and im tired of them on my island
1938,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月27日,"I first learned Main Street Supply opened earlier this week, I've been in 3 times since. I have to shout out to 2 budtenders, Sam was hella nice and let me know the flower I was getting was buy 1 get 1 for $5, so she got me out the door spending $60 on 2 fire eighths. The other budtender I need to shout out is Jonathan, he's as chill as chill gets and he'll get you that high grade for the low price. This place is the real deal, I'll be coming back."
1939,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月15日,"Great selection and helpful friendly employees. Whether you are new or a veteran of dispensaries, this is a good one!"
1940,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月12日,This is one of the only dispensary that does not offer a discount to military veterans. Hard to support them if they don't support out veterans.
1941,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月16日,Super friendly bud tenders! Clean and welcoming environment! It was cool that they also sold clothing. I will most definitely be back soon!
1942,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月21日,"Was taking care of by Jenny who is awesome, patient and very detailed, amazing energy. Security gentlemen upfront is professional and huge. Everyone gets the temperature beeped on the wrist before entering, huge wide selection of product, excellent pricing as well. Happy to have the movement in Alameda. Come see these folks, get in get out. Get happy."
1943,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月7日,"I love this store! Super high quality flowers, impressive! Very good selection, variety of products. Such good vibes and truly kind, experienced staff. Literally every person working here is a gem. They know their stuff if you need suggestions & always treat you right with the prices. Even when they are really busy they are always on top of their game & take care of everyone so well. I always leave here feeling happy & wanting to return asap for another bag of goodies! Thank you for taking care of us, will be back soon!"
1944,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月18日,My budtender was cool so he gets a star. I can't give it five for two reasons 1. They didn't accept my medical card for a discount (the Berkeley clubs do that). 2. I got some Top Shelf Cultivation Jr. Mints and it was garbage. It was packaged back in June 2020. If you are going to sell a $74 eighth make sure it's not half a year old. Checking the dates on top shelf flower is imperative . That is something that should be $35 or $40 at the highest.
1945,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月2日,"Worst dispensary ever! Total rip offs, a bunch of un-knowledgeable kids working behind the counter. You will pay a different amount for the same thing every time you go in there, hella shady math.  They are a total mess with their ""deals"" and policies. They are a disgrace to the industry. Buyer beware!"
1946,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月4日,"The best, and easiest place to find good tree on the island ! Awesome customer service, and great deals . Sarah was very friendly and helpful !!"
1947,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月24日,"We live on Haight Ave right around the corner from this place. I'm happy there's a good dispensary in the neighborhood, but I'm tired of picking up like 5 pieces of garbage per day from this place that people toss on our driveway and the neighbors plants. Wtf is peoples deal? Just throw your shit away. Hopefully mgmt sees this and can put up some signs or something asking people to respect the neighborhood."
1948,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月19日,"My go to dispo, they always got the best deals and products and friendly staff!! Just pulled up for 4/20 and got awesome products. my girl won the Stiiizy limited edition 4/20 box! Best dispo I've been to!!"
1949,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月17日,"Called in asking if they take cards cash and what time they close. Got told it is 9pm. All websites and google said closed at 9pm. I arrived at 8:50 and got told they are closed.  I drove all the way here for that after a call?!! Very unprofessional, I'm very disappointed.  Later on the website close read it says last call 15 minutes before new customer and 10 minutes for returning I was returning had an account etc. Very disappointed. After talking to the security gard it turned into 8:55 as he didn't want to let us in."
1950,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月3日,"This was my first time going in today and the customer service was absolutely excellent. From the security to all of the staff. I had the pleasure of getting help from the budtender Nathan, he was so helpful along with the other staff. Like he said the apple of dispensaries and I'll definitely be back."
1951,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月28日,"I really enjoy this dispensary! I have tried several in the east bay and MSS is by far my fave! It is very clean, bright and staff are very informative and friendly. Melvin helped me today he is great! This is definitely my go to spot."
1952,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月22日,MMIC Patients BewareIt is their policy to overcharge qualified medical patients by 4.75% in state retail sales tax. The tax is exempt per Prop 64 passed in 2016. They also do not have discounts for seniors or veterans. This dispensary does not adhere to the marijuana tax law and is not sensitive to the needs of the community. A complaint has been filed with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
1953,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月12日,"Very clean and spacious, nice security guards and helpful lady at the front desk by the name of betsy. Great prices."
1954,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月30日,"I'm still in shock on how fast the crew at Main Street reacted to my situation. I realized I forgot my money in the ATM located outside  when it was time to pay.  I asked kristina to check the cameras. Daeja proceeded to look at footage. A few minutes later the culprit was seen on camera. By this time the culprit was on the other side of the street with my $60.  Security force lead ""Jay"" crosses the street and brought the person back in. After some questioning I was given my money back. Thank you Main Street! Awesome job"
1955,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月1日,This is one of my favorite clubs to go to excellent service the staff is great and very helpful I will definitely recommend this club to anyone
1956,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月4日,"not happy  at all, poor customer service, visted on 7/5/2021, ask two sales associates for a certain product, givin the wrong product returned to the 10min later waited  30 minutes for a manager whom was one of two sales clerck whom helped earlier, then given another product, got home still not what i asked for, now the manager tells me this is the product she uses, still not the product i wanted at first, please  give the customer the product they ask for or tell them your out of stock, don't make customer's  by something that they dont want are use, wasted 38 dollars on something i dont ues. i have purchased what i wanted in the pass from this merchant, sales associates and managers  should  now the products there selling to customer. not good forced to keep products not asked for."
1957,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月14日,"Great place. Very wide selection and availability. The staff is amazing, very friendly and thorough. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is they don't have online ordering. I'd love to be able to order and just be in and out for a pickup. Even without that, it was a quick and easy purchase. Definitely going back here."
1958,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月22日,"Great prices, great products and great staff! This is my go to spot! :) Always can count on them for good deals."
1959,stiiizy-yelp,2021年10月6日,Totally cool place. Live the vibe. Super awesome the people are nice and they are very welcoming.
1960,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月16日,"As we get further into this new world we find ourselves in... it has given me purpose to Finally get a grip on my finances for my medicinal & recreational cannabis wise. Scared to keep track on what was spent , me & my wife decided at the least.... not to go to dispensaries that have hidden fees. Far & wide we have searched for quality for great prices & considering gas prices the ones founded wasn't worth the drive. Feeling out of hope me & wifey love dining in Alameda happen to find ""Stiizy"" Dispensary on Webster & not only are there no hidden fees, the stuff high quality, the environment is optically pleasant & the customer service is informative & heart felt. Great place to grab medicinal & party favorites."
1961,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月16日,"I visited Main Street when they opened in February. I was impressed with the friendly and knowledgable staff, great selection of products and amazing aesthetics. I stopped by today because it was my last chance to purchase product before the ""shelter in place"" order went into effect tonight. Two security guards stopped me from entering, telling me to remove my surgical mask. I explained that I was wearing it because I was concerned about contracting or possibly giving the Coronavirus to others. The guards were unwavering and I was forced to leave empty handed. Given the situation, I wished the guards had taken the time to ask the management if anything could be done to help me."
1962,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月9日,My main one stop shop! I really love how the staff are well versed with the product! The shop is so clean and reminds me of a high end boutique. Sam was super friendly and like I said knowledgeable when I had questions. I highly recommend this place!
1963,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月18日,"I fckn love this place. So clean and I like that most of the pricing includes tax. Brian needs a raise he knows wassup bout what's really good there. Every time he helps me, I get home hella satisfied from purchasing stuff he recommended. Annabella needs a raise too she's really helpful and friendly. The rest of the staff is cool too tho. This place really got the deals, I recommend this place to everyone I know."
1964,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月21日,"I went in to purchase a topical salve I've been using for several years. The bud tender talked me into another product. The product was totally inferior, So I returned the product one  unopened and they refused to give me credit to purchase the product I initially asked for. The young man I spoke to was very rude, completely insensitive to my medical needs. He could have returned this product to the distributor for their knowledge to make improvements. They could have sold be unopened box very easily, standing behind this product. The takeaway I got was they were trying to unload this inferior product at the expense of their clients. I'll never buy products from them again. The reason some of us shop is for medical relief from pain for our illnesses, the competitors down the street and across the bridge in Oakland are much more compassionate and knowledgeable. As a result, they damaged their business more by their 'profit only practices taking advantage of individuals in medical need', therefore my monthly return busine$$ and word of mouth."
1965,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月23日,"Roommate and I always go here for our needs- staff is SUPER patient and friendly, happy answer any questions we have. They don't have a ton in stock compared to some other ones, but they always have really good choices among what they do carry. Never been disappointed after four separate trips here."
1966,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月2日,I was very impressed with this place. The selection was insane! Amazing customer service and the prices are way lower than other places. Absolutely recommend this place. I have been there twice and will continue going.
1967,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月24日,"Do not shop here. I am not sure how you screw up selling weed, but this joint pulled it off. After the manager threatened me with violence, he is protected by people with guns, I am just SOL with my useless crap I bought from them. Pretty upsetting during a lockdown but there are delivery services which are way better. Way to lose a solid neighborhood customer you asshats."
1968,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月30日,Great staff & quick service!! Super safe & convenience locations! They are still in the grand opening & receive 25%off entire store
1969,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月22日,"I like that Alameda has a dispensary that has good employees, good prices and good music. They usually always have promo deals going on and they also have a hiring sign up, so not only can you get your cannabis products but possibly a job if you apply!"
1970,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月4日,"When are you all going to get some high capacity (greater than 125mcl) CDB oil cartridges that are compatible with the Yocan UNI vape device?  Allow me to elaborate: when I had recently visited your establishment the other day, you had sold me a 125mcl CDB oil cartridge, even though I was wanting to purchase a higher capacity cartridge, but the problem that we encountered was that all of your inventory (with the exception of the 125mcl cartridge) were too large in circumference to accommodate my device...  While I was disappointed that I wasn't able to purchase the larger capacity cartridge, I was pleased that I had left your establishment with a working solution!"
1971,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月27日,Finally happy there's one of these shops in Alameda. They have a great selection of concentrates. I pretty much only buy concentrates so I can't comment on the other stuff. Their prices are good and the store looks very nice and organized.
1972,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月24日,"Came here one night with my boyfriend to check out the new dispensary in Alameda. Thanks to a friend recommendation they have a fire (amazing) selection of everything compared to Harborside in Oakland. I love how quick, friend, knowledgeable the staff was. I especially liked that everything was nearly displaced behind a glass instead of wondering how does it look like before I buy it. The place it so nice and clean. I'm happy to have this very chill dispensary in Alameda."
1973,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月25日,Pods are so outdated consistently keep getting batches from 2019. Recently got a Live Resin pod was malfunctioning and came to return it back before the 7 day policy just so they can say that I have to go outside and hit the pod in their face to see it's malfunctioning who does that during a pandemic. It's not hard to just replace the pod. Manager assumed I was lying ! She couldn't even come explain to me in my face why couldn't I get a refund or a functioning pod she sent a bud tender to do all the talking. What type of manager is that! Definitely don't recommend this place to anyone find a better dispensary! Will never spend money at this place again !
1974,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月5日,"From the front door to the cash register... They all have sticks up their asses. The hourly door security guys pretend like they are bad-ass thug cops. They welcome you with a serious stink-eye and threat to kill you until you show them your ID. No smiles, just aggression. These phony badges need calming more than any of the customers. Lower your head and say clearly, ""Please don't tase me..."" as you walk up to the door. If you get past the ""badge"" the next obstacle is a smiling checkin clerk who gathers your personal information for who knows what reason... She will then point you to the sales floor. This is where there are a lot of green-haired pothead sales clerks that really seem to know how to get high but have nothing to offer... Duh. You will be looking for their next level of management soon, unless you came in high. The management level of sales is where you want to be. They know their product and inventory. This is where you'll find out they are not in the kitchen utensil business."
1975,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月17日,I spend money in this establishment often. They sell me a defective cartridge and won't return it cause it was more than 7 days.  I don't smoke 2 cartridges at oncr so I just opened this one. They have lost a customer for life over a low grade cartridge! Disappointed!!
1976,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月30日,Thank you. You save my dog. He is under stress. He will be in haven.   Thank you again. Great customer services.
1977,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月30日,"So happy to have not only a dispensary close by in Alameda, but also one that is so well put together and has friendly staff!  Will definitely be back!  Please keep heavy hitter cartridges in stock and pls look into the Jade Nectar pet CBD, I'm def a loyal customer for the brands I'm loyal to :) :)"
1978,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月13日,"This is the best dispensary in the bay in my opinion. They have great selection, unreal prices, and it's very welcoming. Thank you so much"
1979,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,So happy there is finally a good shop in alameda. They have a great selection and awesome staff.
1980,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,"Store is nice, staff is great and good selection. Great to have this place in Alameda!"
1981,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,Main Street Supply is the only local dispensary in Alameda with everything I need! Definitely recommend.
1982,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月25日,"Awwwwe mane they have great weed, nice customer service!! Whenever u need Main Street supply got you guy!! On my way! There as we speak lol"
1983,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月21日,"Love this dispensary, frequent regularly. Love the 25% off sale, can't wait to see what future sales / discounts are to be revealed. Thanks Main Street supply for always hooking it up"
1984,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月8日,"Was so excited to find out a dispensary was opening in Alameda - and one that is minutes from my house.  Tried them out today and was dazzled!  The space itself is stunning (former interior designer here) and the staff are welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable!   Right now they've been open a short time, so they are well-stocked with product.  I hope this continues to be the case.  Other places I've been to previously did not.   They started out great and then slid into mediocrity with product offerings.  I hope this place stays this well-stocked!  Currently they have a discount to celebrate their grand opening (could go away at any time according to budtender), but after that. Alameda residents get 10% off every day - so YAY!  A wide variety of price points for flower - if I try anything else. I will add it to the review.  Nice packaging and nice product! I'm a fan!"
1985,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月28日,Im excited about this new dispenser. Very high quality buds for very good prices. I like the variety of the products.
1986,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月4日,Best selection of products they had almost everything I neededThe customer service is A1 Definitely coming back again
1987,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月22日,"Happy to support this dispensary because I live near it, they are very helpful with vape products if they don't have it, will point you in the right direction. Sam was particularly helpful as I needed an entirely new pen. There is a nice variety of products considering the size of the shop."
1988,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月10日,I have a MMIC. Initially offered a discount on purchases. However there is no consistency in the policy. Each time I have made a purchase it is a different discount. Today not only no discount but charged full taxes on a MMIC. Enough is enough. I will be looking for a better place. It's to bad because not only is this in Alameda but I enjoyed shopping here. Just don't want to deal with this anymore. I too will be reporting to state.
1989,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月25日,"Wonderful staff, great deals and wide selection. Nice clean atmosphere and the bud tenders know what they are talking about. Highly recommend it."
1990,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月15日,"I had another great experience visiting Main Street Supply. Daeja was wonderful and answered all my questions. I was able to get the help I wanted and needed to make the correct purchases. The challenge when someone else is sharing the order. Thank you again, Daeja. You are awesome! PS. the only reason it isn't a 5 star is that I am wanting to leave room for a better experience if it can be had."
1991,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月5日,I love that Alameda finally has a dispensary in town and it's within walking distance from my house. The store is clean and bright and the staff is friendly. They've had a lot of monthly sales since their opening. (currently 25% off)
1992,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月30日,"I visited the Main Street Supply today in search of CBD:THC, 1:1.  There is green cross on the outside, street parking.  I like the stealth concept...no cannabis or dispensary in their name.  Also, no cannabis smell.  It is a cute space that looks more like an Apple store than a dispensary :)I was warmly greeted by Mimi.  She was beautiful, smiling and kind.  She directed me to some good selections and was able to get all my questions answered by consulting with her colleagues, as well.  I will back.  Great place...and keep up the great service...Mimi!~Jason"
1993,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月12日,Was so excited when I found out that a dispensary was opening in Alameda! So far so good. I love how clean and bright the environment is. Security guard & front desk staff were so welcoming. There's everything you need. Budtenders know what they're talking about and are the nicest people on earth. AND there's merch. I've been back so many times now. They've got good quality stuff! Very professional. Highly recommend.
1994,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月21日,"Finally you guys are open I've been waiting for a dispensary here on the island omg !! The store is beautiful super clean and bright. Staff are very welcoming and professional, Jon and Sam definitely helped me out on what I needed to get and would recommend them both any day thanks again ! See you guys soon !"
1995,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月1日,I love everything about this location STIIZY is what's up! Staff great products  prices just right!
1996,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月23日,Cool verities. Friendly service. Pretty happy with all my purchase. This place is great
1997,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月10日,"Fabulous staff & fantastic products. Thank you for being here, especially during these very stressful times!"
1998,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月2日,"My go-to dispensary, hands down. Best customer service ever. Everyone there is super helpful and amazingly patient and kind with everyone that walks through that door. Today I decided to write a review because I just needed to at this point. This place is amazing. Anyways, there was this one girl... I didn't get her name unfortunately, I was high as fuck when I went in and I'm high as fuck writing this right now. So with my dumb high self I forgot my whole order in the store and walked out after paying for it, lol. She chased me down the street and handed me my goodie bag! Girl, if you are reading this, I am SO SORRY that you had to run after my dumbass self !! Thank you so much for everything !! I appreciate your service and more!!"
1999,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月25日,"Five stars for Sam and Bri!! Wouldn't want to come here if it wasn't for them two, always knowledgable on the products ranging from the entire case. Love the store, just wish they had more mid range prices- feel like the quality lacks for those looking between spending $35-60 dollars."
2000,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月3日,"This was the first dispensary I've ever been to. Great customer service! Sam was super helpful and polite! Great products and deals as well! However, they've given me the wrong strain twice when I've specifically gone in and asked for the specific type of flower. They don't allow us to touch it so I can't double check it. I called 5 times through the week periodically being told by their employees I'd be called back and compensated. Then after another week goes by and the manager still won't speak with me about their mistake. After all of it the assistant manager tells me very rudely that there is nothing they can do after telling me for a week they'd compensate me. Very unprofessional."
2001,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月26日,"Very disappointed with their unwillingness to stand behind a defective product they sold me. I had been going here about a year when I was sold a Stizzy package about 3 weeks ago. When I opened the box 3 weeks after purchasing it, it was EMPTY!  I went back to the location to return and replace it (not asking for a refund),  and the store manager would not replace the package because  it was more than one week since I had purchased it, even though they had in their records that I had bought it!  I'm 73 and not trying to scam anyone, yet they treated me as if I had made the error, not them.  Whatever happened to honoring their customer service? They would not even consider a replacement and was told that there was nothing they would do to make it right.  I asked to speak to the Regional manager, but they never called me.   I'll never go back here again.  There are other places that I'd rather give my business to where I would feel like a valued customer."
2002,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月25日,"So glad to see a dispensary in Alameda. This place is great highly recommended, great location and building too."
2003,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,Best prices in the bay. Always quick and easy to get what you need. Def my go to spot in Alameda.
2004,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月2日,"I came in and everyone was really friendly ! Christine in the front was kind and sweet , Louis was my bud tender and was super helpful in choosing my stuff because they had a very amazing variety !"
2005,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月30日,Always good service and selection. Good sales and prices are reasonable. Recommended.
2006,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月28日,"First time ever in a supply shop and they are super friendly and helpful. The rep took her time to educate me and answer all my questions. Glad I stopped in, and I recommend you check it out for yourself."
2007,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月27日,Probably one of the nicest dispensaries i've been to. I was really impressed and they have great service too :)
2008,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月5日,"Main Street supply had wonderful staff, their are always helpful and welling to answer any question I have. I also recommend Main Street supply to everyone."
2009,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月2日,Christine is amazing and a huge help for someone that is clueless! Will only come here.
2010,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月2日,I love Main Street supply! Such a great deal. Great vibes. Everything on point. Definitely check it out!
2011,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,"Been coming here very often, always very helpful and reasonably priced! Wished everything was labeled on the counters, but staff is always willing to answer questions!"
2012,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月29日,I love this place. Convenient location and great deals. I always leave this place happy! Give them a try if you're in the area.
2013,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月28日,Super hip clean establishment. We an Awesome knowledgeable staff and great affordable  products !
2014,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月23日,This is one of my favorite weed shops in the bay.. great prices... friendly staff... atm on site... great location... and an amazing selection of products from bud to clothing and other kool stuff stuff
2015,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月30日,"I go here 2-3 times a month and spend a good chunk of money. I absolutely love it here but everytime i come in im praying i dont get one bud tender. Today i got him.. His name is Austin. He made this the worst expirence ive had buying bud in any club. Everytime i asked him what was good he would huff and puff. He only showed me one strain that was Crap. I asked if he recommends anything else and he didnt. I would ask to see the weed and he would tell me the drawer is locked or he cant let me see it when they show it to me EVERYTIME i come in. I gave up and was just going to buy the one 8th i picked and the hash. When checking out he goes "" im sorry your upset that i cant show the product to you. its against policy and the others who showed you are breaking the rules/how would i like to have manhandled weed"" (its in a jar dude.. forreal)he then gets in my face later b/c i had told him he was the worst bud tender i had and i just wanted to pay and leave. Im sorry my opinion of your service hurts your feelings. Just man up and get better dont get in my face. reason i give 3stars is because one of the managers i didnt catch her name and Hannah saving the day otherwise there would be 1 star. The rest of the staff is honestly fantastic, i trust their opinions haven't steered me wrong so far. Every time i ask any of them they are really great at helping and i always walkout happy and with some great weed in the end. I haven't decided if i will be going back.. Don't really want to deal with running into him again."
2016,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月16日,"Finally, Alameda has its very own dispensary!  Main Street Supply is clean, well lit, has friendly and knowledgeable staff and a great selection of products for every price range.  I will definitely be coming back!"
2017,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月18日,I went to Main Street supply for the first time a few weeks ago. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I was able to find everything that I need. I will most definitely be going back again.
2018,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月2日,Christine is the best :D . Main street has the best deals out here. Usually 25% entire store so highly recommend!
2019,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月30日,First time I walked in I was shocked by all the stuff I saw around me laid out very nicely so it is easy to view everything. They have so many different brands I've never seen before and great products I haven't seen very many places. The staff is super nice and helpful.
2020,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月14日,"Great location, good prices and an awesome staff. Kayla helped me find exactly what i was looking for! 10/10 would recommend."
2021,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月4日,They were so helpful! And personable as well! I came within 15 mins of them closing and they didn't make me feel like I needed to hurry up at all.
2022,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月28日,"i love this place! every time i come i'm greeted with cheerful smiling faces! everyone is so knowledgeable about the products and very helpful. Not to mention the 25% off discount. if there's a line, it moves fast. don't waste your time going to magnolia or harbor side, main street rules!"
2023,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月2日,been here multiple times and customer service is always great.  love having local supply on the island.
2024,stiiizy-yelp,2023年8月1日,Great experience with Cody behind the counter. Knowledgeable quick and efficient. Would come back for sure!
2025,stiiizy-yelp,2023年6月12日,"The security here is wild. Be prepared to be scrutinized and strip off all your bags, and anything that you wouldn't let an obvious criminal have. I'm surprised I didn't have to take my shoelaces out.Back in the day the mission used to be the place to go to find a dispensary. Now if you can go anywhere else, avoid the Mission if you can, and that counts for this place."
2026,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月17日,"I'm honestly super bummed - I loved coming here! like I've literally come here since it's been open, spent probably thousands of dollars, and my experience today made me not want to come back. This was the first time I ever received a faulty cart from stiiizy. I bought a stiiizy pod and had it for maybe a day, hit it TWICE, and was left with resin burning my lips  and spewing out of the top of the cart (actually something I researched saying that it means it's a faulty cart). I obviously didn't want to hit it anymore and they always say if something is wrong you have 7 days to come back and they will replace it. I waited 2 days & bring the pod back into stiiizy for someone to check it out and Jeff the manager said because it wasn't 1/2 way full there's no way to replace it. I didn't understand that bc I tried to explain to him that the pod was literally leaking into the into my stiiizy battery (pictures attached) and there was no way I could have hit it because it was leaking from both end, and how would the pod have still had more than 1/2 it's content when it was leaking... They didn't replace nor discount my next pod. Anyone experience this?"
2027,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月3日,I met Julian on Monday at l y t t in Pacifica. He did a father's job representing this company he has wonderful people's clothes I recommend everyone to go there I was truly delighted. With his outstanding yes please his people style.
2028,stiiizy-yelp,2023年1月23日,"ILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!Terrible customer service. I went to pick up indica flower, the cashier gave me 3 options of indica and I picked the one with the highest THC which was 31%. I trusted that they gave me indica because that's what I asked for and thats what was repeated back to me. After I got the weed, I went to run an errand & once I got home to roll up. I seen that on the package it said ""HYBRID"". I don't smoke hybrid. Indica only. I didn't open the package, they also sent the receipt to my email so I didn't check it until I was getting ready to take the package back. I go back to the store to basically switch to a different one, not return but just switch it out. The person at the front desk told me they don't accept returns. The manager also came to me and told me that he doesn't do returns. I'm not understanding why you can't let me switch it out when I'm a loyal customer and come here often. The package was no where near open. What type of shit is that? Definitely won't be coming here ever again."
2029,stiiizy-yelp,2023年4月5日,"Only thing I hate is I always get there right when the doors are closing at 945, but everyone working there is always extremely helpful"
2030,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月27日,"This place = great experience!!Wow! I walked out of here with a steal! They hit me so many times with great deals. The day I went, flower was 20% off, and first time customers receive 10% offOliver helped me make the best purchase. Ended up with biscotti and bday cake pods, cookies PR, and the bIIItes (which aren't in NV yet and they need to be!!!!) we fell in love with the stiiizy biiites!So anyways I got all of that for around $86 after tax. My jaw dropped too. Stiiizy on Mission has my business every time I come back to SF now. Place is super clean and also only one person allowed at a time due to covid restrictions."
2031,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月28日,I bought my stizzy probably a year or two ago and I loved going from cartridges to pods. But In the last month or two EVERY single pod I've bought leaks into my battery. It doesn't matter where I get it from either. Really upsetting that the quality has gone completely downhill
2032,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月21日,"BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE YELLED AT. THIS PLACE WILL KILL YOUR VIBE. I totally understand that businesses have different protocols for COVID, but this place makes you feel uncomfortable. The first time I came here a short-haired tatted budtender helped me and she was rude af. You would think workers at a dispensary would be chill, NOT HERE.  Every other dispensary I have ever been to have had nice workers. So here was my experience today...I arrived with my sister (my sister who I live with), and we got our temperature taken. Cool. Next we checked in and the lady at the front said we had to stay six feet apart but get helped by the same budtender. Like I said, businesses can have whatever COVID protocols, but theirs is a little offputting. I was helped by a man that was cool, then my sister decided she didn't want to get anything. She walked up to me and a different worker said we couldn't be next to each other. My sister kindly said ""okay, I just wanted to accompany my sister"", and he rudely said ""WELL THEN YOU GOTTA GO OUTSIDE"". There must be poor management because these workers are WHACK. Save your time and money and go to any other dispensary. It's also cash only... why? It's 2020 and it's more common for dispensaries to take card now. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying cash if the workers weren't so cold here.The dispensary around the corner looks way more welcoming. I actually tried going there but they were closing and recommended going to this trash place because they opened later. They should just tell people to come back when they're open because STIIIZY is horrible."
2033,stiiizy-yelp,2023年2月20日,Lotta hella fine selections here at Stiiizy! This place is off the hook! Couldn't even find some of their dank in other dispensaries! I'mma be coming here more in the future to check out what latest dank they got!
2034,stiiizy-yelp,2022年12月8日,"Went in for some things and waiting in line for 15 minutes or so , and bro with the fucked up flat top decided to wait till I was ready to pay to say he can't cash anyone out after 10pm, if this is the manager of the store I feel for them, big fuck you to you"
2035,stiiizy-yelp,2022年11月2日,Defective pods and terrible customer service. The very first vape pod I purchased with them was defective. I had to return today but did not have my original packaging so they denied any exchange or refund. Apparently this happens a lot. So many other places you can go. Skip this one.
2036,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月3日,"Damn you guys are so rude. They rushed me to buy my shit (the guy with a full face covering and head thing on?) He was a rude little guy. Anyway I bought the weed I seen printed online for 16% on Riverview farms website.. when I stepped out that dispensary that shit said 8%. (Mind you I didn't check the percentage because I was sure it would be 16%) as it stated online.. I went back inside to ask for a switch of another strain because I didn't even open it yet smh.. he told me ""I cant exchange flower blah blah blah.. the new girl doesn't know what she's talking about in the front so yeah."" What? Bruh. $40 wasted. Was also trying not to make a scene because I have $33 to my name I'm stressed enough.Please stop hiring rude men who can't even greet you when you walk up to the counter.. I cant even get high on a mf Friday night. I think ima stick to buying weed somewhere else. Bleh"
2037,stiiizy-yelp,2020年6月4日,"2 things here.1 Customer Service: This place has one really bad apple.  I love the staff here and they are very warm and welcoming but this one woman which is probably hispanic and is a little heavier ( I do not like to make labels, I just don't know her name and would like to describe her) She is completely RUDE.  From checking in clients to helping them pick flavors she is really rude with a super attitude.I honestly get uncomfortable every-time she helps me because she is NOT helpful and stays having a dirty look on her face.  You can tell she doesn't want to be there and literally give no effort.  I will literally let someone cut me inline so she's not the one taking care of me, because I know she wont. When I asked for something on the lower end she gave me this look that just rubbed me the wrong way and It has just stuck with me since. If I'm feeling like this I am sure others are as well.  And I feel bad for the rest of the amazing staff that has to share tips with her because she for sure isn't putting in work like the rest of them.2 Flower quality: For the most part the flower is good.  But I got a bag a while ago that was the absolute worst thing ive ever got from a club. They should not be selling anything like this, taste, smell, gross.  the weed tasted like it was either cut to early or had some kind of chemical burn. Just Nasty, and then they call it ""Blue Cookies"" or somthing thinking you're going to get that.  mmmmmmmmm Nope!  No club should be able to sell this garbage. waste to money. Picture below and beware."
2038,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月8日,Piece of shit scammers they sell half grams and say they are full grams this is a scam and company they deserve a zero everybody must know about this they sell half grams and charge you for a full gram they are completely scamming their customers this is complete bullshit
2039,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月21日,"Normally, I would've been surprised to find out Stiiizy has such a low rating. But after finding out they are a franchised business it makes sense to see the rating be so low. 1! First and foremost this, location did away with the one thing that made them super legit and always had me walking through the door. My military discount. Wow! Not just that but all discounts.2nd. The rude and horrible customer service that I received from the girl that must've thought that she was too cute to read off some hand written tags. It's not my fault her leg was hurting and she's working an unorganized sales floor that has the Stiiizy pod products in 2 different sections instead of having, ""two sections."" I'm spending over $200, forgive me for wanting to know my options! Get a better set-up!I really wish dispensaries would stop hiring these ""so-called"" cute girls thinking they'll sell more and in actuality they end up having horrible customer service because they actually have to work. And it's not just standing there looking cute getting tips. And then they get hit on so much, they end up thinking every guy is going to hit on them and their customer service lacks.But then the very few real people and ""guys"" who are actually knowledgeable and willing to work, end up having a hard time getting those jobs, that they would actually benefit the business... Due to hiring half-assed wannabes."
2040,stiiizy-yelp,2021年11月10日,"Had gone to this location a couple of times specifically for disposable vape pens. The customer service on my first experience was sub- par, they assume that you know how their system works and how the store is organized, nobody seems enthusiastic to help. Yesterday I went to return a faulty disposable battery and with about half of the pod left in they claimed it stopped working because I was out of wax. There was clearly plenty of oil left in the cartridge and it seemed to be a problem with the battery. They told me tough luck and sent me on my way. Definitely the last time I will support that store and NEVER buy any stiizy products anywhere else. This company needs to be ran more professional and train their staff on customer service and product knowledge. Very disappointed"
2041,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月18日,"******WARNING!!!!!!****IF YOU WISH TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS!!!!If I could I'd give a negative star. Their service doesn't even equate to zero because the way the treat you will have you feeling attacked and violated.They disrespectfully kicked me out for wanting to have a conversation with my own biological sister whom I was with in the store."
2042,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月10日,"If you close at 9:50 update your hours online (weedmaps, leafly, etc).Even the Yelp page has 10:00 but under it there's a note that says 9:50. Which is it? Get your house in order. Update your hours or, you know, stay open til you say you will.And if you're not gonna bother, at the very least at least pretend to care that a patient rushed to your establishment instead of shooing them away like pests when they arrive. Is this one of those places where people go to get disrespected? Maybe that flies in LA, but it doesn't in most places. And by looking at other reviews it looks like they have a culture problem they are either unwilling or unable to address."
2043,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月17日,Was at the Stiiizy Mission St. location last night and bought a honey leaf OG Kush cartridge that was defective but did not know it until I discarded the receipt and packaging in a dumpster. The SORRY ASS MANAGER would exchange my cartridge without the package that it came in. Their weed is for shit and they sell defective Vape cartridges. Once in a while they'll have a strain of weed that's good but other than that if you want quality stay away from this location.
2044,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月6日,"I just went into this dispensary for the first time. My boyfriend usually buys me gummies for me to help sleep at night. ANYWAYS, I figured I'd go with him to check it out, considering I've never been here. Yes, this place was compliant with all the COVID protocol's, which I can appreciate bc my daughter is high risk. We are standing in line on the same sticker six feet from the other people in line. Out of no where this guy yells across the counter, hella loud at me to stay 6ft apart from by bf. ??? Ok. I get it. So my bf moves up first, I stay where I'm at. It becomes my bfs turn to go up to the counter, so I follow him..  because 1. I've never been here, idk how this works 2. We are together 3. Ultimately we are paying together. 4. My bf was going to point out the gummies I've tried vs ones I liked etc.... Then I get semi yelled at again and was told to ""get back!!""..... ???? Wtf?  I said, ""it's ok then, I'll just wait outside.. what's the point?"" I wanted to take a look at stuff with my bf just bc he's the one that knows what I'm looking for. But anyway, I figured he can grab it like he normally does. So I go stand outside, some creepy ass dudes driving by honking and whistling at me. I go peak inside to see if my bf is wrapping up and paying.. and I see there's a guy who WE DID NOT COME WITH all up on my bfs back,  looking at the same shit my bf is (not even 6 inches apart) but yet I couldn't stand next to him to take look? Makes no sense. Also, I'd like to add, they didn't even grab the right wax he wanted, but he was too nice to go in and complain. Yes, I'm sure whoever was working could've helped me, but being called out by this person 2 times in a line of 5-6 people (all guys, mind you) definitely didn't make me feel comfortable wanting any customer service from them. Maybe they should spread their product out more... And have the line completely outside.. in case people want to go in with someone. I can't be the ONLY person, that wanted to stand next to their significant other while picking out their product(s) ((WHOM THEY LIVE WITH. ))Also, If you're going to call out a customer (in front of people) maybe you should have a staff member walk up to them and explain the situation (so what.. each of us would take a turn to pick shit out, and my bf would come back and pay?). Or have security explain how it's being done with COVID. Security, and the front desk lady knew it was my first time, but yet no one explained how anything worked. Just overall unprofessional."
2045,stiiizy-yelp,2022年1月22日,I've been coming here for a while now. I always have a good experience with these guys. Some bud tenders might be more chill than others but overall everyone is really nice. Regardless of other peoples own negative experiences I'd still recommend these guys. Prices are legit and they have almost everything you want.
2046,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月2日,"This club is a joke, they gave all these discounts just to get people to come in so they didn't close during covid, just to take them away DURING COVID . Also it's not like it's poppin the lines are long because the bud tenders are slow and and it seems like there are 10 people working behind the booth when really their talking about nothing and 1 or 2 people are working , I will not  be coming back , everyone to Urbana around the corner, they take card and delivery. This club can go back to Southern California to be honest"
2047,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,I give this place another shot because my little sister wanted to try plus she just turned 22 so it's all good. Thank you so much Jason for all your help. You helped me my 1st time there and I so happy you helped my lil sis this time. You're so awesome. Love the way you were very patient with her and all the information you gave her. Thank you so very much.
2048,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月13日,"Bummer. Service here has gone downhill since they changed from LaCorona. Stopped carrying the Lowell farms I liked or the dog walkers in the tiny tins. Front desk attendant had to shout instructions at me over their loud music. Maybe turn it down? Now cash only. They make you use this silly atm up front. Husband and I went in for a couple things and even though we arrived together, weren't allowed to stand near each other the required 6 feet from the counter and look at the menu. Budtenders kept shouting at us to separate. I used to stop by here often, but I won't be back."
2049,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月11日,"Had a pretty terrible experience at this dispensary. I went in looking for a pax pod (yeah my bad), and when I was buying it I asked the person helping me twice if the pod would work with pax. He said yes twice. I walked out the door and realized that the label didn't say pax at all. When I went back in, I told them my situation and they had me stand back in line and the manager told me that they couldn't return it or refund it at all. She said that the package looked opened, even though I had just left the store. It was extremely frustrating because I don't own a stiizy battery, and they were unwilling to do anything about it even though their employee had confirmed with me that the pod was compatible with pax when they aren't. I will not be coming back here. Highly recommend purple star instead - better prices and better service."
2050,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月16日,I've been a customer for many months.I've always been treated with respect by the staff and managers. Luis helped me out today and he was great.
2051,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月21日,"I love Stiiizy products, but this store location doesn't have the best customer service. And they never have any deals going on like every other dispensary I've been to. What's up with that? I do think those sealed baggies they put your items in are nice though. For whatever that's worth..."
2052,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月19日,"Looking at other reviews I guess I'm not the only one who's dealt with a rude sales girl who loves to give attitude and yell at customers. Came here with my dude and although we were buying separately we were standing next to each other and the crazy chick up front starts screaming at us to be six feet apart. Like ma'am, we literally live in the same household so how does it make sense for us to be six feet apart? Even if it is the store policy there's absolutely no reason to act all crazy about it. Anyway this place has hella bad vibes, don't recommend."
2053,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月29日,I love coming to this location! I just went about 2 days ago and the Budtender Gems was killin it recommending so many options when I was getting overwhelmed with all the flavors. They told me to try to the CDT Pods and I recommended White Truffle and it's now my new favorite flavor! Gotta come back some more!
2054,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月11日,Went in today wanting to buy some products. Wanted to support a local business. Needed to buy my months worth of supplies. It was so loud I could not hear the employee behind the counter; they proceeded to pull their mask away from their face and continued to talk at me. I told her I needed a minute; and they continued to talk AT me. Please let a person look and ask the questions. I was hounded so much I left and went to another shop.  The security guard and reception were very nice. The sales employee was too aggressive.
2055,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月31日,Really loved the experience. The receptionist had a great personality and made my first dispensary experience as smooth as possible. The guys working in the back knew exactly what I needed based off what I was looking for and the product definitely met those expectations. Really great place and will be returning for future re-ups.
2056,stiiizy-yelp,2022年5月21日,"Catherine has to be the best and most bubbly receptionist I have ever met!!!! You guys need to make her a budtender, 10/10 I'll deffffff be coming back"
2057,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月20日,Everyone is friendly here. They have social distancing tapes on the ground and rules to follow. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. It's a clean establishment. It's cash only. They have a ton of selection. Parking is metered and not too terrible.
2058,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月30日,"This shop is awesome!! I go here a couple of times a week because they've got the best prices around. I purchase my Heavy Hitters cartridges and all my flower here, esp on Thur and Fri because they have flower deals on those days. I live close by near the Mission District and their location is only 7 mins away from my home. Everyone from the security to the front desk staff and budtenders are uber welcoming and professional."
2059,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月25日,"What a joke. It clearly says online that they're open until 10pm daily. I showed up at 9:44pm And they turned me away stating that they ""close in 5 minutes"", Pointing to a sign on the door that says ""10 AM to 9:50 PM daily"". I showed them the current time on my phone and the time listed online, apparently they don't like being proven wrong because the guy shut the door in my face. I'll definitely be going around the corner to Urbana from now on. I normally do since it's a way better business and has friendlier staff, but they close at 9 PM and I couldn't make it in time."
2060,stiiizy-yelp,2022年4月7日,"Always a lit time with Alycia! If she's there definitely go to her, she treats me like family. Literally! 5/5 stars for this place. Definitely gonna come back here."
2061,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月16日,Good shit they have the best bud and prices in Bay Area. And the best part is that all the tax is included in the price you see
2062,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月2日,"I've been here a few times because it's convenient and chill, but today I had an experience that turned me into a forever loyal customer!I had an issue with a broken vape cartridge I purchased, and it turned out to be incompatible with my battery module. Even though they were super busy while I was there, Issy (the manager) did some in-depth research for me to determine the type of cartridge I should get in the future, and helped me find a battery that would work with the products I have currently. She truly went above and beyond to help me. This place rocks and I will definitely be making this my home store!!"
2063,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月22日,Always a go to spot in The Mission. The staff is very friendly and always directs me to what I am looking for. The Stiiizy staff is the best.
2064,stiiizy-yelp,2022年7月26日,"As a ""tourist"" I visited this location and my ID was scanned in ( I'm from Out of state) Spent a good amount of money. Note my DL had a piece of tape on it from being cracked, not broken. I flew across the country and this same ID was accepted via TSA. Returned to make an additional purchase 2 days later and was turned away because of that same little piece of tape. Now mind you, my ID was ""scanned in"" at my first visit and my ID was valid when I spent money but then not today? It's cool tho... I will spend my money else where. Cannabis is legal where I'm from so you're Not doing me any favors, and Out of principle I will not be purchasing from your chain and  no one I know will be neither. Girl at the front counter ( little nerdy with glasses,but cute) is rude as shit and pulls the ""state compliance"" card and refuses to listen... rude and just talks over you like you've done something wrong. Bad for business attitude for sure."
2065,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月13日,The receptionist cat really made my day when I walked in she helped me get in and out by giving  me helpful tips like the daily deals for the day and the st pattys deal couldn't ask for better Customer service !
2066,stiiizy-yelp,2019年9月24日,"It's impossible to list why I'm so upset. This used to be a great place. I was told some time ago that they were undergoing a remodel. This is on a whole different level, something else. It was a take over from a massive company. All the neighborhood charm, all the local flavor, and any deals that helps retain people and welcome people from the neighborhood back as if they were just family members...gone. So is my business.Robert, the security guard was the only familiar face to greet me when I returned after the 'remodel'. After I checked in, they scanned my ID again scanned my rec again and welcomed me in with a 10% first time visitor discount as if I'd never been there.I found that extraordinarily insulting. Especially since they asked if it was my first time back since the 'remodel'. After they found out I was a regular, they still treated me like it was my first time into not just that facility but any cannabis dispensary. They can keep my 10% I just want my old place back. I might just have to go back to buying illegally. At least those dealers know you. Wipe this place off your map because they are no longer La Corona. Not in name, not in staff, not in atmosphere, not in practice, not in neighborhood, not in anything. It doesn't even fit The Mission which was the whole mission of La Corona in the first place. I remember a local hardware store in my hometown sold out to a major company. All the old staff that had been there for 30 years and kept that place running left because of how management treated them afterward. They closed a year later because all the local business keeping it afloat stopped using it. I hope that happens to this new place."
2067,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月14日,"I wish the budtenders didn't make me feel like I was wasting their time and that they at least ACTED Like they were in the business of customer service instead of just tolerating my questions about products. I'll be avoiding this place after that experience just now. Especially, as a female, ya'lls MALE employees should treat female customers better."
2068,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月31日,"I love coming here, prices are just right, the people are awesome and well where else can a bunch of ladies start dancing to BBD's Poison on a Friday afternoon? :)"
2069,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月1日,"NO CAP I came in like the very last minute I could. I felt bad but Stiiizy is always on point. The staff is always friendly and I love the energy they radiate. Tonight Ernesto helped me get in and out and made sure my order was in before 10. After that they can no longer take orders or accept payment. Even though I came in with 5 left to spare, I didn't feel rushed and the service was great! Thank you Ernesto!"
2070,stiiizy-yelp,2021年12月27日,Stiiizy think they slick . Smh San Francisco put the no tax on the price of weed because people didn't want to pay 60 plus for an 8th and went to the streets. So now Stiiizy already put the tax on the weed price . So the 8th still 60 plus . Y'all funny but it's capitalism at its finest.
2071,stiiizy-yelp,2020年10月5日,You can't look at the weed before you buy it. The staff are uneducated on the product. The staff is aggressive. You would think people selling weed would be laid back and chill but it's like they are all angry. The Davis location is further and smaller but there is much better service and the staff can actually talk about the product AND they let you see your weed before you purchase it.
2072,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月30日,"Overpriced.  The place aesthetically is great but too bougie for my taste.  The weed is subpar, so you're paying for the expensive visual experience.  The cashiers have very little knowledge of the products and strands.  Great if you want to take a pic for Instagram, not if you want some good cannabis products."
2073,stiiizy-yelp,2020年11月30日,I was visiting from Seattle I've never been to a cannabis club in California before. I was not aware of the brands of cannabis in California and this club but Sofiea helped me to get familiar with products at this club. I left with exactly what I wanted.
2074,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月7日,Cool prices but the staff is hella weak and don't care. Just had to walk out cause I was waiting to be checked out but they were taking more customers in to where no one could ring me up. Thanks for the effort won't be coming back here again
2075,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月1日,Very bad experience All the time when I asked for product the said out the store and the give me bad products I will never  go there
2076,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月6日,"These guys have the best love rosin badder and other dab/pods. Joe. S. Hooked me up, he had to dig for the one I wanted. Cherry pie live rosin badder"
2077,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月31日,"LOVE THIS STORE. Love the daily deals, love the vibes! Tee and Liz are the best and I can't wait to shop WAX WEDNESDAY!! Best in class service here every single time !!"
2078,stiiizy-yelp,2021年6月15日,Pretty sure the I's in STIIIZY stand for impossibly inept imbeciles. If you're gonna shut the door on medical patients' face because it's 9:49pm then don't have your hours as 10pm. Came here from pretty far away because their prices were better and it was the only time we could but every time they're just rude as hell. The budtenders obviously know a lot but god forbid you ask them any questions. Not to mention one of them took my friends information from her account to incessantly text her then got all pissed off when she said she wasn't interested. Dawg you really out here being the worst to customers and then make them too uncomfortable to come back but whatever y'all make your coin harassing people. If you made it to the end of this review then you might as well drive down the block to Greenthumbs.
2079,stiiizy-yelp,2022年3月14日,"Reason is that they do not support black people , even the ones that work for them . The Bay Area supports black people but stiizy employs blacks just so they won't get backlash but they treat their black employees and Latin employees like trash . Yes they will find few blacks to say they been treated well but I know for sure they don't , from San Francisco area to concord area all the way down to alameda county . I can tell you about their employees getting treated unfair and customers and contracted employees also . That's why they don't be getting sales like that also cause of how they treat their own staff and customers . How you in the business but don't know customers or what's actually legal for them to do . Anybody need factual information on how they are treating employees or customers , we will be having reviews and discussion on a platform coming soon , and we actually didn't want to do it like this but something has to change big weed companies don't care about their customers or employees. I wonder how the board will feel about this information of this club operating the way they do . Culture vultures , I should actually start posting the videos of customers and they way we treated as customers"
2080,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月12日,Solid spot to scoop all the delicious flowers and concentrates. Clean location with all the proper protocol. Appreciate the hospitality and recommendation from Dennis.
2081,stiiizy-yelp,2020年3月8日,"Charged different prices for same product last 3 times , on same day ,with same daily deal bad customer service 4 out of the 5 times I've been.The product is great ,the attitude and the getting lied to about pricing is enough to buy from another source."
2082,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月30日,"I love this cannabis shop. I come here a few times before I have to go back home. Everyone's nice and loves to explain to me in detail, on what I'm buying :) friendly peeps. Would def recommend to my friends who go to cannabis shops!"
2083,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月18日,"WOW!!! Front desk guy was MAD Rude to me!!! I came in all chipper and polite, dispute the fact I may Be another industry person he sees 20th time that same day, But his customer service skills lack! He mocked me for coming in, straight up fake typed and was like ""I will get on it and let someone know. Your only the 100th vendor that came in!"" He didn't even give me a chance to even set myself apart. He just tore me apart. Then chewed up a menu he asked me to leave. If this is what the brand is about.... being haters and judging people at the front door, I want no part of it. Any Customers who seek compassion or friendly service, It's not at that shop. If your a little hype beast, and love to troll around. Then this is your shop!"
2084,stiiizy-yelp,2021年3月6日,First time customer of Stiizy. They sold me expired Kanha Cannabis Infused Gummies. The tenders was brusk and had limited knowledge of the products they were selling. I will be contacting the Office of Cannabis to submit a formal complaint.
2085,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月7日,"This place kinda blows now that they remodeled and changed to stiizy. The people are still friendly and the door guy is the same thankfully (he's dope) but this place is coming off hella corporate now. But the product was more expensive for the same stuff and they CHARGE 3 DOLLARS to use your damn card now! The ONLY good change I noticed was that if you're a sf resident you get a 5-10% discount or something like that. Other than that, this place isn't worth it anymore."
2086,stiiizy-yelp,2021年7月8日,"This rating is for Jasmine! I called in to ask about apparel and she was polite, fast and efficient. Thank you for your help!"
2087,stiiizy-yelp,2021年4月16日,"check the date! check the date! check the date! this place is known for having great deals for moldy, old and expired products. even the $80 flower is way beyond old!! ask for the date before you buy anything because they will not do a return or refund. i know"
2088,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月2日,I dropped by for the Grand Opening. The staff was friendly enough however everything is behind glass with no prices listed. The items I asked about were not in stock even though they were on display. The clerk helping me did not know the products. On top of everything else they had a tip jar out! That is like going to Walgreens and having to tip your clerk.  If they can't pay the staff enough nor educate them I don't want to shop here.
2089,stiiizy-yelp,2021年5月18日,"be careful what you buy here!!! i made the wrong decision to make a store pickup order through weedmaps. there menu says live but that may be a lie! i purchased a 8th here for what there ""live"" menu said was quite fresh and high on thc. what i received was completely the opposite. the 8th was very low on thc, it was close to expiring and the 8th looked extremely wrinkled and crushed the manager said the false misleading advertisement of the product was not there fault but weedmaps. however upon speaking to customer service it was clearly stiiizys fault on misleading consumers on purchasing false  authenticity and quality of a product then refusing to take ownership when there receipt even says otherwise. if thats not close to stealing i don't know what is. the manager could of easily deemed it defective but at every turn chose not to take responsibility. Out of all my years and all the clubs I have ever been to this was the first time a dispensary FAILED to take responsibility for there wrong doing. pretty shady moves by such an establishment.---- DONT COME HERE, they sell EXPIRED weed then won't refund you AT ALL even though the moldy weed is potentially hazardous for anyone with stomach issues. --- GO TO *PURPLE STAR*----- or ----Mission Organic---"
2090,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月16日,"STIIIZY replaced la corona wellness in the south mission. It has really renovated the space making it visually appealing. Clean lines, bright lights, attention to detail make this store feel like a great modern shopping experience. Everyone I have interacted with is so friendly and helpful. Yea, it skews to STIIIZY branded products but they also have a lot of other products that will keep you satisfied. Also gotta say I got the STIIIZY pod system and like it much better than pax. The toke are smoother, taste is better and the cartridges seem to last longer. Overall would recommend."
2091,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月27日,Awesome place and staff. Just moved up to this area from San Jose and am so glad to stumble down here. Girl at the front desk was super friendly and great. The guy helping me helped me find good choices that I don't regret. Definitely coming back here.
2092,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月2日,Chris had the worst customer service. Very rude and not helpful. Made me not want to come back here. First time here and was a bad experience.
2093,stiiizy-yelp,2020年2月23日,"This place is awesome!!! They have super nice employees that help you out with any questions you have. Also, I've saved so much money because they always have deals! The gummies they have are my absolute favorite"
2094,stiiizy-yelp,2020年5月22日,"Lost my battery and happened to be in the Mission, walked in and was assisted by Francis-- sold on live  resin Ice Cream Cake, Bloom Disposable pen Maui Waui . excellent service. Thank You!"
2095,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月11日,I was walking home from work the other day and I noticed a big poster inside this place where a African-American man is smoking a marijuana joint. This is another example of black exploitation. Whoever owns this place should be ashamed.This place should definitely be boycotted by civil rights advocates.
2096,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月14日,"What's up with buying a $40 joint SMALLER THAN MY PINKY and when you light it up the thing it's just ashes no smoke. Went back into the store since I am not a new costumer nor smoker, just for them to escort me out on v-day... when this happens the manager should've checked it and offer a replace instead of arguing with the costumer saying it was halfway...what part of all ashes no smoke did he not understand..oh and on my way out there was someone else complaining that his stuff wasn't good either DEFINITELY NOT RETURNING"
2097,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月1日,One of my favorite new clubs in San Fran. I can't in there first time a few days ago and had to come back because the quality was amazing and the staff was very friendly! Come in for great quality and friendly service!
2098,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月4日,Solid prices. Solid first-timer discount. Solid knowledge and service. Left with great recommendations and stuff that is every bit as great as advertised. Welcome to the hood!
2099,stiiizy-yelp,2021年9月8日,"Awful company. Particularly awful store. Went in for the first time, asked for a vape cartridge. Budtender offers bla bla bla. It's weed so I don't really care. I say sure. Product is not viewable because of their packaging. I walk out of store, open packaging. Vape cartridge does not fit on my battery. I have that circular/cylindrical battery that is by far the most common. Like the one everyone has. I didn't even know there was another type. Apparently there is. Budtender knew they offer 2 types but didn't have a thought to maybe clarify which of the 2 types I needed. He just presumed to know. I turn back into the store. Bare in mind that I had left the store 30 seconds prior. Manager is argumentative in that passive aggressive sorta way where they're making it like I'm the one being difficult. It's beyond absurd. They tell me absolutely no returns/exchanges. The product is mine now but they'll happily sell me a second cartridge. They tell me to phone customer service. The number they provide does not lead you to anyone. They rip me off for $35 because of their own mistake. Could have had a customer for years.  Whatever."
2100,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月20日,S/O to Izzy @ Stiiizy. I really appreciate how patient she was with my indecisiveness!!
2101,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月29日,"Today I walked in and was very displeased with the way my orders were taken care of. Female worker was too high on the job and just wasn't on the same planet I was. I let her know about the mistake she made and that I wanted a full gram carts, ended up getting half grams and it seemed like all she could do is laugh about the fact that she made a mistake. I came back in trying to fix my issue which was to get my order right, but solely based off the employees mistakes no matter what, I was told by managers ""Sales are final"". Even if the employees lack of attentiveness was the reason why my order was MESSED UP!! They say thats POLICY..."
2102,stiiizy-yelp,2020年8月20日,Staff are not there to make your experience better they only want to sell you weed i would recommend barbery coast in sf there is two locations both are excellent
2103,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月18日,"Sophia was amazing!!!! great customer service, friendly store, top notch weed, highly recommend"
2104,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月1日,I Love this Dispensary! I've been coming here for a few years now (before the Grand Opening) & I'm very pleased with the new set-up. The staff is hella friendly & very knowledgeable. They have fire flowers & lots of other great products. I really appreciate the the staff's patience especially when its so hard to choose from everything they have. I would recommend anyone here. Especially if you suffer from any medical conditions. There is so many CBD products to choose from.
2105,stiiizy-yelp,2020年12月8日,"the staff was super welcoming, we took forever but the home girl Sabrina really took care of us and took the time to actually look through their stock to make sure we left with some that zaaa"
2106,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月24日,"First of i never been here right but was told they get pretty packed  but I literally jus called and a man named Gabriel picked up and i said "" hello how are you just wanted to asm if you guy's were busy at the moment and he was speaking with another customer at the moment then i said ""hello?"" and he said your good togo to the other customer but gave me hella attitude and said ""i said yes we're busy"" but with a stank ass attitude.  Never been in AND NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TOGO IN THANKS GABRIEL YOU RUDE AHH"
2107,stiiizy-yelp,2021年2月16日,One of my favorite dispensaries in the city. Good music and very friendly staff. Especially Joseph! Always provides 5 star service and has great recommendations for tree. Will return!
2108,stiiizy-yelp,2021年8月15日,"bud tenders just want to upsell you to make commission. not thorough about products , i felt very rushed from the counter . dont go to this stiizy location , they will kill your vibe, rob your pockets and laugh about it !!"
2109,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月29日,"First time I went I was so disappointed by the dry weed I bought. The second time i mentioned this and one of the staff grabbed two bags and said ""this is what dry weed sounds and feels like, this is what fresh weed feels like. I won't do that to you."" And I got some fire weed and I thank you! The 3rd time today I asked dude with the fluffy hair if he had anything good and not to high priced and BAM. 36$ eight or some stupid fire CRUs Pure Kush. My man! This is my club now!"
2110,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月14日,"I went in for the first time last night excited to see what they were about. I had already knew what I wanted to purchase after looking on Weedmaps, to make things easier. Although it stated they updated their inventory within 3 minutes of looking, when I had got to the counter the budtender (who had a good attitude) sadly had NO KNOWLEDGE of the merchandise. She stated that the item I wanted was sold out after not knowing where to look. When I asked her to show me a similar option it was like asking as car salesman to show me a house! They had a special promotion for new members. When I asked about that deal for the day she continued to not be ANY assistance. Beyond annoyed that Urbana (my go to was already closed) I went down the way to Dr Greenthumb who is always hassle free. I'm sad writing this review! As much as I thought I'd love the place when I walked in, I left quicker than I waited in line. Either train your staff with product classes or get new people in there all together!!!!!!"
2111,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月3日,"Dennis gave great customer service, and he is very friendly and social as well gave me great recommendation."
2112,stiiizy-yelp,2021年1月18日,"Great Weed Club , Richie helped me out ! He's very knowledgeable and great conversation"
2113,stiiizy-yelp,2020年9月4日,"I've been here maybe a handful of times mostly for daily deals and the close proximity to my house, as I usually go to Purple Star and used to frequent Dr Greenthumb when it was cookies. Anyways I decided to jump on stiiizy board and treated myself to 2 half g pods and a rose battery for $60 (each was $20..normally $25). Figured can't beat that price as $25/20 per half gram pod! I have enjoyed them but I have recently got a Dart battery (480mAh) which blows the stiiizy(210mAh) out of the water...I think its got closer mAh to the biiig stiiizy battery? Anyways as for the actual location its great as theres usually decent street parking and you can usually get away with parking in safeway lot for a bit. The security and receptionists have always been friendly and have zero complaints about! The budtenders have been pretty good but the last time I was there I was overcharged. Hopefully I can get the rest of my change back even though it's been a little while since, but I bought 1 half gram pod on a Sunday when they are supposed to be 20% off and for some reason I ended up only getting 5% off?? I had a new trainee BT who was being trained by another BT so there were 2 of them but the newbie rung me up and idk how the BT okayed the price and everything. I'm extremely shy and have really bad social anxiety and if I feel the least bit intimidated I tend to have trouble speaking up for myself. Thus I should have but didn't feel comfortable trying to argue the correct price. I'm on an extremely tight budget due to being broke thanks to the useless EDD. I know that's my issue but just trying to explain as I'm not trying to be a complainer just a very meek and socially awkward patient The first time was perfect & BT took the time to explain (w/o asking!) all diff products and listened to what I was looking for so she was able to help me find the perfect flavored hybrid & indica pods! I got Rose battery instead of Rose Gold but that's ok still cute. Location is top notch as the actual store its self is super modern and looks almost too modern and nice.. seems like most newer dispo's are trying to use this clean hi tech modern look which is very professional looking. However there is only one or 2 of the product displays so I never really feel comfortable looking thru all the displays to see what I'd like..which sucks cos I saw a product I've been searching the entire bay area for but it wasn't listed on their menu so I guess I'll have to ask them whenever I go back next. Wish they carried more Dart battery pods because they hit the best out of ANY of the vape pen batteries on the market! Overall the budtenders are the only thing that might use a little more fine tuning however they arent that bad and there is usually SO many of them that it's really hard to give a proper review on them. Overall clean easily accessible location with pretty good selection but the pods are always in and out of stock. Most of the time they are usually out of the specific size and strain pod I want but can usually find a close alternative."
2114,stiiizy-yelp,2020年4月6日,"I came in here and bought close to $400 worth of stuff on Friday 2/27. One of the pods was defective but by the time I noticed it I was back in San Jose(where i live). I cane back on Tuesday 3/3 with my defective pod, box, and receipt. As per their policy on weedmaps and their website, I thought I'd be getting a replacement pod but I come in and every bud tender is a straight up clown. Every budtender pretty much said that my pod was mainly gone so they couldn't do anything for me because the manager on shift isn't very helpful and would only honor me with 20% off on my next pod, heres the deal though, its a DEFECTIVE LEAKY pod. Do they know what the definition of a leak is? Its when things accidentally lose and/or emit their contents which in this case is a $60 gram of concentrate. This pod was already missing 25% of its contents when I first got it, it maybe leaked away another 50% of it, I showed them nonstop that their is still some left in their but it just looks messy because I had the pod in my pocket on the hour car ride back to SF. Nobody wanted to hear me out, they obviously don't know their own product or are too lazy to help out a customer that spent almost $400 just a week ago. Special shoutout to Maria, she is terrible person and an even worse employee. Only person in this establishment that deserves any respect is Elizabeth who was the original budtender and manager who helped me out on Friday 2/27, too bad she was out that day when I came back because even a couple budtenders hinted that she probably would have given me a new pod. Anyways, this place sucks, budtenders probably think they're hot stuff cause they work at Stiizy but they're all lazy bums."
2115,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月4日,"I liked it more when it was la corona. It's alright, but cash only and they doNt  post the correct prices."
2116,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月21日,"Love Neka!!! She was so amazing and so sweet. Really got educated on everything. Such an amazing place with even better employees. Neka needs a raise, only coming back because of how awesome she was!"
2117,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月16日,"So I considered giving 2 stars but I decided to keep it REAL as we do in the Bay Area...I personally loved La Corona and referred everyone I knew or came in contact with to them. But STIIZY. The Grand Opening was semi exciting due to my bud tender Shauna's  positive attitude and knowledge of both the old and new product but after that things went completely down hill. The dispensery is way too bright...the deals are gone...and its way too loud in there, on top of the fact that at least 3 to 4 people scream out welcome to STIIZY & stay STIIZY every time you walk in. It's redundant and annoying ..Maybe LA residents appreciate that but the Bay DOES NOT. There aren't any prices on any of there products so you have to wait for someone to tell you which can be very time consuming...needless to say I haven't been bk since the Grand Opening"
2118,stiiizy-yelp,2020年7月16日,"Good customer service and great quality products, not to bad of a wait in the line, and their efficient every time"
2119,stiiizy-yelp,2019年12月6日,"i found Stiiizy on Weedmaps earlier this week when i was planning a busy day and was trying to find a place along my way to pick up some concentrates. I have made two trip here since and i gotta say they have some pretty awesome prices, and huge selection of just about everything. the staff has been very friendly both times ive been in. My only gripe is that the concentrates display is kinda difficult to view and with the heat from that lights in the display case the concentrates start to break down and dont look so attractive, i was looking for a particular consistency but everything in the display was altered and there is no knowing how long they have been sitting with lids off baking on low. also wasnt able to smell them. i decided on the ursa skittles which in the display had a sugar-y consistency but when i got home and open it it was much closer to a diamond sauce. -online menus need work, concentrates are in multiple categories and hard to filter though"
2120,stiiizy-yelp,2019年11月10日,"Visiting the area to eat and I accidentally spot this place and I love stiiizy  so I went in just to peek. Place was nice as hell and professional. Dude who took my id shared the same birthday as me which I thought was dope since it's it a birthday you hear to often. They had a new flavor that was blue gummy that I want to try! But they weren't all pushy like some dispensaries. I was on my way back to where I live, and just glanced at the shirts which were nice shirts, and the guy who took my id went and just shot me whichever one I wanted and I thought that was bad ass. I will be back to visit with lots more money, thanks guys for a good first experience."
2121,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月6日,Best place on Mission/30th. Great service and great solid prices. You get what you pay for for sure. Highly recommend being a member here you get a helluva a lot more deals than anywhere else
2122,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月24日,"This is one of the best dispensaries i have ever been too, the workers are really friendly and they have the best pods and also have some dam good weed, its decent pricing and not overpriced one bit, i strongly recommend every one in san francisco that smokes weed to try out Stiiizy"
2123,stiiizy-yelp,2020年1月18日,The employees work hard to keep the line moving and seem to always offer great deals. Not to mention it's near by. I would definitely recommend!
2124,stiiizy-yelp,2019年10月24日,Super friendly and have a great selection. The prices are really good and they will treat you with then best respect MUST COME!!!!
