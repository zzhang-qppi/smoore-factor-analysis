0,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月13日,It wasnâ€™t like the one in the picture but Iâ€™m still satisfied tho,3
1,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月21日,This is fine it's their website that sucks.,2
2,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月27日,Very good battery but the product I used was trainwreak with that battery 10/10..,4
3,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月30日,Badass battery. Go Biiig or go home!,4
4,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月29日,Fix your website. It said to drop by between 9 and 10 and you were closed. Total BS.,3
5,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月22日,this battery hits hard if you are looking for a good dab pen,4
6,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月13日,Nice big clouds. Long lasting battery. Just what you need my high tolerance friends,4

9,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月16日,"Battery lasts about 3 days and so easy to take it on the go, also very small for pockets",4
10,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月25日,Love the big stiiizy! It charges quickly and has a long battery life. The pods click in easily and fit very secure. My brother pulled one out to show someone and my 8 year old walked in and asked what it was. I was able to quickly convince her that it was like a Roku or Fire stick type thing with 0 questions lol so it works out great if youâ€™re needing to be discreet.,4
11,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月15日,Works wonders! Gives me pretty good hits compared to a 510 or regular Stiiizy batteries. Would Highly recommend!,4

14,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,Battery size is very compact and discreet. Love the size and shape.,3
15,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年3月28日,Itâ€™s sleek and a little more discreet. Packs a good punch. Iâ€™ve tried many 510 thread batteries but they would always break or voltage wasnâ€™t strong e0ugh. So I finally gave in to getting A pod type battery. Definitely happy with my purchase.,4
16,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月3日,First time buying the Stiiizy brand. Great experience!,3
17,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月29日,"IMO..They Are Cheap And Taste Nasty I mean leave a bad taste in your throat., Also I Din0 About The Slick Ass Batteris I Cant Seem To Hold On To Them.PSssssT..Batttey does 0t stay Charged Very Long Either..",2
18,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月22日,Would definitely buy again ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,3
19,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月31日,It is a very piney gassy pod! I like that even tho itâ€™s a indica strain it doesnâ€™t make you sleepy to the extent of being stuck. You can definitely shop and hit this pod,4
20,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,I loved dosi. Best flavor.,3
21,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月9日,"Do-si-dos has been my favorite stizzy carts for a long time. It's best after work before dinner - I relax, I get hungry, and I sleep well.",4
22,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月31日,"I remember this feeling like a traditional hybrid and didn't 0tice the indica too much.

The experience will vary, person to person but for those that prefer indica... this may 0t be the best option. This is probably good for social stuff.",3
23,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Second time Iâ€™ve bought the dosidos and does 0t workâ€¦,2
24,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,I enjoy this strain very much,3
25,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,Listed as Indica but package said hybrid. Assume it is an Indica dominant plant. Best for relaxing and sleeping.,3
26,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月28日,"It made me feel energetic, hungry and hard to sit still at times. I donâ€™t mind it when Iâ€™m having a productive day, but when youâ€™re playing video games, this fades really quick.",4
27,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月25日,itâ€™s one of my faves!,3
28,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"This pod is a distillate oil, this is meant for road trips and getting out of your 0rmal head space! The vanilla flavor along with some nutty 0tes too makes this a dope ass high experience! Rip it and head over to grab a coffee or take a scooter ride through the neighborhood, pick this pod up with that GIRL SCOUT GREEN battery and head out on adventure with this STIIZY! ðŸª",5
29,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,"Read a good book after a few hits, would recommend",3

36,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月2日,Checked the QR code and it said it was the second one with the same code and itâ€™s 0t suppose to be like that each one has a unique code thatâ€™s y is 1:1,3
37,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月18日,Quality product for a fair price. You get what you need at a fraction of the price of their competition. Would def recommend.!,4

69,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月24日,Good sativa. Really wakes you up and gets you going. Smooth and easy. Didnâ€™t really taste like anything but it wasnâ€™t a bad taste either.,4
70,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月15日,Blue Dream is always a good time,4
71,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月4日,"This blue dream is the best to relax and think! However, any full gram Stiizy is 0t worth it. So much of the solution comes out as tar and sticks to your teeth, making them look black. This also causes more than half the product to be wasted, so, again, 0t worth buying a full gram. Stick with the half grams if they have it.",3
72,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月7日,Feeling a little anxious? A puff or two during the day eased my mind and got it refocused on what was important. It did 0t make me feel sleepy or high.,4

77,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"Definitely a solid choice, though I think there is some blueberry flavor added that could be toned down. I'd prefer Stiiizy rosin pods but Artist Tree Fres0 doesn't carry even a single one. Weird. So this is the one of the next best choices.",4
78,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,Love the taste,3
79,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"It did meet my expectations, I do recommend this product!",4

81,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月25日,"I sucked 90 percent of the wax through the mouth piece. I ate alot of wax and was hot. It was a good high but 0t worth hitting it and sucking out a good portion of wax every time,  and being clogged.",3

89,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月15日,"This is my favorite Stiiizy Pod flavor because the Blueberry flavor really goes well with the Blue Dream extract. I've only found a handful of other OG Pods that have good flavoring, but this is by far the most consistent every time. If you're a fan of flavored nic vapes but want to switch to thc, I highly recommend this as a flavored vaping alternative.",5

109,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月28日,"Blue dream is my all time favorite. Only strain I  smoke. Very enjoyable, happy, energetic, outgoing. Brings you out of your shell. A lot more active also great for the late night activities. I highly recommend",5

131,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月4日,.....excellent.,2
132,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月21日,"Stiizy is probably the best of best of the disposable Vape Pens - Blue Dream, as a flower product, had always been one of my favorites:  zesty taste (esp. in vaporizing flower); immediate calming & produces energy (I usually walk 2-3 miles daily) - with the Stiizy it is even more enhanced; and a little goes a long ways!",5

154,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月17日,"Great for being distillate. Doesn't burn, great taste, I tried this and the Do Si Dos along with Platinum Jack and I believe this one has live resin terps in it as I don't get an irritation when exhaling. Lasts a lot longer than typical 510 carts as well and a better hit/air flow. The battery could be better, it dies pretty fast, but they were free, so what do you expect? lol. 9/10 stars, would buy again. Great for sleep as well.",5
155,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月11日,This is by far a GREAT product - both quality and taste were on point and will be buying again.

156,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月8日,Iâ€™m 0t sure why exactly but Stiiizy seems to give me anxiety instead of high and they donâ€™t seem to last very long,3

174,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月17日,"Depending on the mood, this strain can either make you forget about the long day at work or help you get the mind juices flowing.  But even with the mind going everywhere can be asleep in mid thought in moments",4
175,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月30日,"The king is here! By far one of my favorite strains, STIZZY does good by this strain by hitting you hard and quick leaving you open for either deep thoughts or mindless jokes and riffs to do with your favorite group of people. I don't get harsh munchies but I definitely feel this one for a lot longer than other strains. King Louis is a fantastic choice for a sesh with the squad or just watching your favorite videos at home.",5

182,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,This is hands down the best tasting indica from stizzy. It’s a straight mango taste very sweet and a little sour I thought it was a sativa for a second given that’s how they all taste. If you want flavor this is it,3
183,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,It does its job,3
184,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月27日,"I lived in LA when they dropped this product from their original store, it is my favorite and will always be, 0 one can compete with this company.",4

195,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月31日,"First time using Stiizy pods,  I must say I really did like this one, flavor was decent but i dont get them for the flavor just an added bonus.  That being said I enjoyed Gelato, but the high didnt seem to last very long but I guess that could be me and building up a resistance to it sadly... Overall, I liked this product, Didnt have any leaks, and so far so good.    You will get a tingle body high or well I did, pain free I must say which is always nice and what I use this for, so will...",3
196,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月15日,"Decided to try this brand, initially the pods were great, but after a few uses the PODS leak into your mouth and get jammed up.

197,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月27日,I only go for potency the higher the THC lvl is what I care about & what I'm after. I do 0t give a F about terps. Gelato is usually one of the highest testing carts & I like the strain.,4

200,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Great product  Great price,3
201,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月8日,Honestly this pod looks used. I’ve never had an issue with any pod I’ve ordered but this one is clear with dark brown air bubbles almost as if someone had already taken some hits.,4

213,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,"Kind of disappointed with this strain, had higher expectations for a lasting high! I felt relaxed but never high stimulated! Almost like vaping a cbd distillate",4
214,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月21日,"Local Stiiizy lover Jodie back with a0ther top tier flavor!!! Gelato has always been a frozen treat and 0thing shows this better than the treat you experience from smoking a Gelato Stiiizy.

215,stiiizy-iheartjane,2019年11月27日,The only thing that I didnt care for was the taste of the gelato. But over than that it's one of my favorite strains.,4

219,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月14日,"While it's smooth, it tastes like I'm vaping grape Kool-Aid powder. As an all-day smoker, the taste quickly became overbearing and unpleasant. This product feels like it was developed for twelve-year-olds, 0t adults. 

It's a nice a relaxing buzz, but too much leaves me feeling agitated. There are better strains out there for me. Blue Burst is ideal for anyone who habitually s0rted Pixi Stix as a child.",5
220,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月23日,yummy flavor never disappoints,3
221,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月8日,Blue burst from stiizy tastes great. It tastes like grape pixie sticks. The feeling is smooth and very relaxing. As a hybrid you expect a little sativa and indica but this one is mainly indica feeling without the feeling of sleepiness. Definitely recommend this flavor over other flavors.,4
222,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月12日,Good product!,3
223,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月12日,"If you like cheap gas station vapes that taste like a stale sugar free gummy bear, then you will love this. I spent $112 just to throw this directly in the trash. I don't even think there is any THC in this because there is 0t even the slightest bit of essence of marijuana. I knew as soon as I opened it and smelled the nasty fruit smell that I was 0t going to like this, I tried to do an even exchange for a pure strain in the same brand and was told 0 so I tried one hit and couldn't even...",5
224,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月24日,The bud was good I used it to relax,3
225,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月14日,Worked really well for numbing my back pain and helping me just chill out.,4

238,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"My blue burst pod was a dud, this isn’t a bad thing but made me realize, if your pod doesn’t work, keep your receipt and head back same day, D2 employees will gladly help you out (same day) 
The flavor is super strong and taste like a refreshing spoonful of blueberries, it’s a distillate oil pod with a great taste and a high that hits right in the head, the taste and strong high of course, makes this worth buying in a gram pod, pick this up with a blue battery and rep that BLUEBERRY STIIIZY! ��",5
239,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,The high is good but I don't like the taste,3

664,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月5日,"Bought 2, 1 worked, one did not. Required bank intervention to get refund due to poor customer service. I want to like Stiiizy products but this makes it difficult to trust the brand.",2
665,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月11日,"This battery is horrible. cheap, low quality metal and it only stays charged for a few hours. no wonder they gave it to me for free at their patient appreciation.",2
666,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月21日,"I have purchased 3 defective pens from stiiizy, successfully exchanged 1. After the headache of the first exchange I just said F**** it and ate the next. As a medical patient, this really sucks. It took over a month to deal with customer service, and ended with my bank stepping in because of stiiizys bad business. unbelievable. I couldn't make this crap up.",1
667,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月20日,I have had so many of my friends tell me that this is the best one on the market..... I can assure you it isn't. The packaging looks cheap and the weed is just ok.,2
668,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月6日,"Bought a replacement battery since my last one stopped working. This battery stopped working just like the one before. The micro usb does not charge, no light shows when itâs plugged in. Iâve had it just about two weeks.",2
669,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月23日,"Honestly as a parent at times you need something to help you decompress. As the kids became older it became harder to explain why mommy and daddy had to take walks outside in turns to ""get some air"". These have become out life savers. Get some nice relaxation in, all without smelling. We still take our walks to get air BUT these hit so hard that it only takes a few minutes outside and no mess! Love you Stiz",5
670,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月28日,"But seriously, besides being absolutely adorable, this pen is perfect! Iâm super clumsy and am constantly dropping my vape pens. Several times Iâve broken a full cartridge, but with this design, itâs really difficult to drop it at an angle that would break. Itâs also lightweight and discreet, itâs small/ slim enough to fit in even small pockets or a wallet. Another problem Iâve encountered with other pens is having to replace the batteries more times than I can count because the plate get pushed into the battery over time from over tightening when charging or connecting cartridges, but again, this design allows you to just drop the cartridge in, and it charges like a phone, solving both issues. I love it!",5
671,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月6日,"I love how it looks with my freshly done manicure, I love how it looks when its just sitting on my counter, I love how it looks ALWAYS!!

676,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月23日,"So, as for a general review of the battery, it's really good! It has a nice, discreet form factor, superb build quality, a battery that lasts for a good while and the pods fit perfectly into their slot and look very sleek. It works great with all Stiiizy pods, even the live resins. Now, as for the color, it's a very nice pastel pink with a smooth, matte metal surface. It's a really nice, calming color that's also a bit easier to find when you're looking your battery to take another hit.",5

694,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月8日,nice and discreet!!! love the color and the feel,5
695,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月15日,I was having a bit of a hard time trying to decide which color to get. I thought I had picked the rose gold at the counter but I'm not trippin cos I really like this color and I'm happy even if it was a mistake cos this one is perfect...the purple seemed s bit too bright and the rose gold not girly/pink enough for what I was looking for. Perfect shade of pink because it's pretty discrete and is overall just a very classy color. Super lightweight so I can see how people tend to loose their pens really easily especially if you're hi af ð Glad I ended up picking up s stiiizy system cos (so far) I'm very happy with it since I also got it on Saturday when the batteries and pods are 20% off so it was $60 for the battery and 2 .5 gram pods ð,5
696,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月17日,"I quite like the stiiizy system. The carts taste better than a lot of 510 carts ive tried, although there are tons of brands that make 510 carts vs only 1 for stiiizy. The pros of this are that every stiiizy cart you buy will be pretty good because they all are made by the same company and that company happens to be pretty good. Another pro is that the carts arent too pricey, but this varies depending on where you are and what dispensary you are shopping at. The last pro ive noticed is that the stiiizy carts seem to last a long time, idk if its because a lot of 510 thread carts are under filled or something, but i got a half gram stiiizy cart to start out and i have been hitting it non stop and it has easily lasted a longer time than all 510 half gram carts ive ever had. And it looks like its still half full. The cons of this product are that there is only one brand that makes carts, so if the quality starts to drop then you cant just switch brands and keep using this battery.",5

727,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月22日,"I have been using batteries for years and this was my First Stiizy purchase. I am SO DISAPPOINTED with this particular battery, the magnets used to hold the Hella expensive pods are WEAK!! The first day I had it I stored it in my bra, this is where I put all of my batteries when I don't have pockets. Anyways, ran several errands and when I pulled the battery out to hit it. There was NO pod attached, It had fallen off and I didn't even notice!!!!! $50 gone!! Come on Stiizy, this is a joke. The quality of the oil is hands down Bomb asf BUT for their price you need to do Better with the batteries!!!! I have another brand of battery and the magnetic is so Strong that I've NEVER lost a cart or even have it come detached from the battery even after dropping several times. I'm now a little uneasy about buying more pods for fear of them falling off. I don't have money to be throwing away. PLEASE Stiizy, do better and change the Structure and Quality of the batteries.",2
728,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年11月12日,The battery will charge red and show it being dead but after the 45-60 minute time period it will still be dead and wonât even turn on white when hitting with pod,2
729,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月8日,"Itâs a nice battery I like how it charges with an android charger so if it dies on me I can get ahold of a charger pretty easy, easier than it would be if it was the standard 510 thread charger . I love how itâs available in different colors . Just wish more cartridges were compatible with this battery .. but all in 5 out of 5ð¤",5

The charging port is an android charger which is very convenient. The cart is magnetic which I also like. I still have my âcanâ pen since I havenât been able to find another brands making carts for stizzy pens. My tender hooked me up with a nice Stizzy bag and lanyard. The lanyard came with a stizzy pen rubber holder so I donât lose my pen, which apparently happens since theyâre so slim and small. Maybe a find my pen app? Need help contact me.",5

757,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月10日,"Great design. It feels awesome in my hand. But, invest in this only when you are ready to leave all others behind. 510 threads are everywhere, making them very easy to switch and try new varieties. The pod is better preforming, but limited to certain brands. So, are you a Stiizy person? I am not a brand person, because each oil brand has given me both positive and negative experiences, so I like to shop around. With this battery, I can only buy their products. That would be cool if their product was premium, but even the bud tender suggested a different brand. I just had to try it for myself.... itâs not premium, it just tastes great. Now I have a battery that I might never use again, unless I decide to give your oil another chance.",4

783,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月29日,"love mine i shouldâve purchased sooner, hits well and carts are affordable. bad thing is that it seems like it does go through carts quite a bit faster than a regular 510 battery does. shouldve got the orange or any bright color instead tho bc it blends in with everything so i lose this one all the timeð",5
784,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月17日,"Poor rating for the batteries yall. Just take care of your batteries. Keep your rubber tops for the bottom of your batteries as well as for the top and bottom of your carts ya digg!? Lord knows how much crap can end up in pockets. Don't OVERCHARGE! It doesn't take long sheesh. Been rockin 2 black batteries since. Now I'm rockin the Rose w/ the black lanyard. My next one is going to be a Red battery for my Sats! Fasho! The finish on these batteries are so amazingly done. I might just get a blue one for those evening Indies. Cant hurt to have back ups. They normally last me a couple days before I have to recharge. Brids are on the Rose and on the rise. Ha ha! .... Sorry I had to do it... It's about color coding too people. On the carts I use red, green, and purple sharpies to fill in the lines but for the most part my tastebuds know my favorite kines. You know what would be dope tho is if the lines where color coded red, green, or purple. JGEAH! You know my STIIIZ!",5
785,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月29日,I bought a blue one a week ago and have had that time to use it every day. Iâve been researching different strains and flavors and just ordered more cartridges and a second [red] Stiiizy battery as a backup/spare. I love the gentle hits I can take and I feel like I can better control my dosing. Happy,5
786,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月5日,"This pen is so slick and portable I take this thing everywhere. I still live by other cartridge, wax, etc. pens, but this makes the vaping so effortless. The pods can switch instantly, they attach to the pen magnetically. The pen itself is only on when you breathe thru it, no buttons. The pods seem to last quite a while, don't need to breathe in long to get a decent hit. 10/10 my dude",5

829,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月19日,Ive been using mine for about 3 months and itâs sikk af even though the white light gave out it rips hard would recommend,4
830,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月8日,i have to say it hits really really nice almost fells like inhaling nothing even when doing a blinker but the battery does not last very long even when just doing straight pulls [not a blinker] it dies rather quickly so make sure to charge before going to a sesh or when you ride solo other than that it is a great battery would fully recommended,4
831,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年6月4日,"a good battery, it hits well and i feel like i get a good hit even when itâs almost dead. it does seem to die fast or maybe i donât charge it long enough. also if you leave your cartridge on while charging it does waste a little bit of it so be aware of that. but i like the one guys idea of having a few batteries for the different strains so i might do that",4
832,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月16日,is there anywhere else i can purchase one besides there web page ?,2

835,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年6月23日,"I bought this vape and 3 pods, it was great for a day or two but after that every pod I dropped into the battery started to leak into my mouth and then eventually just forced itself out of the pod on its own. I never charged it with a pod in place and always left it in the upright position. I do not recommend this product for the price of the pods especially if they just leak everywhere.",4
836,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月2日,"so I purchased two batteries, one for my girl and I. I love the thing they're really low key and great on the go when you just trying to sneak a toke. Unfortunately, my battery went out 8 days later. Lights won't turn on or charge.. sucks man..",4
837,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月9日,"I have been using my Stiizy for 4 months now, and am about to put it down for good. Body: the body of the battery looks very sleek, but it's surface is slippery and hard to hold onto. Combined with how thin and light it is (cheap aluminum construction) the included lanyard is necessary. The lanyard is honestly the best part. Performance: for a proprietary product, it leaves a lot to be desired. It has consistent connection issues between the battery and the cartridges no matter how clean the contact points are. Over time this becomes a consistent problem. The carts also clog very easily. For every three hits I take It having to unclog it and it is really frustrating. Add to that the carts seem to be very inconsistent but mostly on the weak side, and it makes this one to avoid.",4
838,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月8日,I bought the red stiiizy pen and a week later it stopped charging out of nowhere. Donât know what happen to it just stopped charging. Do you know the problem or what could of happen?,3

No more sneaking out on the room and go to the bar and open the cabinet under the sink and reach further just to get the lens box and pick a flower and grind it then pipe it then go outside to smoke 5 times and go hide it again and go to restroom and drink a glass of listerine just to elimanate the smells and go back to the room and get to bed. While gf asleep. But this one is awsome! Iâll tell her Iâm just go wee-wee, then open the sink cabinet and reach underneath to grab the pen w/ velcro and smoke 3 times, no smell all good go back to bed. From 30mins to 3mins. Brooo wtf!!

843,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月22日,Starter kit sounds like its a WHOLE set up. VERY MISLEADING FOR ALOT OF PATIENTS. Whats so hard about calling it a battery on the box.. GEEZ,3
844,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月26日,"After a few uses it pays for itself, people claiming it leaks have to realize their salvia has to go somewhere, right? Make sure your lips are dry and your cart wonât âleakâ. I assumed it leaked as well however moisture does travel I like the design itâs sleek and discreet. Awesome magnetic ð§² snap on pods that tastes great and clean. For only around 25 bucks depending on your dispensary you get a cool, quick charging, automatic puff detection; no need to hold down a button because the way it works is simple yet very efficient, you simply âpuffâ away and it lights down to let you know when itâs time to be charged. Very fast minimal charging time, decent battery life for the small physical size of the battery. Overall a good product from an awesome company that is setting the new standard for quality.",4
845,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月9日,this thing is amazing. if you're going through a pod in a day wow get a life or a job. I can't believe somone would suck on it all day thrn complain it doesn't last.,3
846,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年1月4日,"Love the battery. It's not as resilient as I would like - had one break because the two contacts inside the battery seemed to fail and no longer cobust the product. STIIIZY support was awesome and got me another battery replacement from my delivery guy. They reached out and contacted the business to get it set up. I love the look of the product, great overall design.",4
847,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月8日,"The plastic is cheap. Once you get past the wow phase of the sleek design the problems come to the surface. Battery dies faster than any pen Iâve dealt with, 3 or 4 pulls and you can feel the tip getting so hot that sometimes it even spits the oil onto your tongue and this thing is a magician, your pod can be gone in a day and a half not even at times. Cool design, definitely needs a lot of work. I wouldnât suggest this without doing your own research cause everyone else would have you believe its godsend but in my honest opinion after buying 20-25 Iâm done. Unless they redesign the pods I wonât be coming back",4
848,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年3月18日,"I LOVE that the pod isn't glass because I have dropped it 3 times so far. It hits hard and very smoothly and a little goes a long way. In my area most places seem to sell it, and everyone has been out of the Plug Play, so I finally decided to give it a try. I am happy with it overall. This unit is physically lighter and a bit sleeker than the Plug Play, and doesn't require you to push a button to hit, but I feel like the hits are slightly harsher with the Stiiizy. With both I'm a bit leery of having a battery than can ONLY be used with ONE company's cartridge bc if they suddenly go out of business/stop producing quality products/raise their prices 400%/piss me off somehow, than I have invested in something I won't be able to use. Having said that, I have been very pleased with both thus far, and while I don't think Stiiizy is AS amazing as the hype suggested, the quality, style, and ease of use have won me over. A price decrease wouldn't go amiss though... ð",4

Charge the battery the ""Pen"", the STIIIZY for a couple hours and make sure to stock up during the sales at your local Dispensary, the PODS are addictingly good and hit every time. More expensive but way worth it. You could buy like four or five pre-rolls and still not get as high as these pens. All you really need is a few hits and you'll be ready to rock n roll a",4
850,stiiizy-weedmaps,2017年12月16日,Figured it was worth the 20 dollar gamble on the battery and 30 (at my shop) for pod was worth the gamble for something portable and discreet... I was very happy to find it went above and beyond my expectations. As a hater of vape products and a skeptic of the content quality /quality of builds I have to say Iâm impressed. May have even changed my opinion on vapes.. actually feels like a dab and battery lasts a min. Very pleased.,4

900,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年3月17日,"And honestly as did I ! I'd like to think I'm a pen aficionado, I have tasted most of the leading brands and even some non branded pens. I've always struggled with finding the one that could truly deliver the feels I've been looking for. I wanted something to ease me through the day but if needed could carry me to the moon and back. In my line of work I needed something discrete but still cool, and honestly ever since I stumbled upon Stiizy I've been a fan. I have tried plenty of flavors and the one that is currently in my poclet is biscotti I'm all over any indica that can help me through the day, and if needed take me to that place we all want to be at. you're welcome. and #StayStiiizy",1

931,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月18日,I have tried several different vape cartridges made by different brands. Stiizy is definitely one of the better ones I tried. At first I was put off by having to buy a starter kit. I thought that was lame but considering the design (pods) are totally different than other brands I gave it a pass. Glad I did because the product in the pods is very good and that's what counts in the end. Worth a try.,4

Iâm light headed from those 10 attempts. Moreover, I noticed the oil has been sucked out of the top holes!! OMG now the pod is sticky with oil. My lips have a thick oil slathered on them too. I needed dawn dish soap to wipe this oil off me and the pod. In the end, I liked the oil but the damn battery is killing the whole experience of the pod. Why would Stiiizy allow that to occur?

At first I noticed that the draw seemed clogged but it would hit after quite a bit of effort. After looking it up on google I figured I got a defective pod so I went and bought a replacement pod and it was still hitting the same. I transferred the pods to my buddies Stiiizy battery and the draw was great. Once you hit the Stiiizy until the light blinks it feels like you took a dab off rig. I contacted the vendor whom I bought it from and he said it was a matter to discuss with Stiiizy themselves and referred me to their website. Im waiting to hear back from them but Iâll update this review once I do but after looking reading reviews on separate websites it seems this is a common issue.

So 1st off the pen does not come charged its completely dead which was odd because every battery i buy is always somewhat charged when i buy it. 2nd when i charge it fully and try to pull for a hit it constantly keeps blinking red/white and not allowing me to hit it. I keep looking up trouble shooting for this issue and seeing if anyone else experienced this issue but i cant find anything. Really disappointed about this because the whole set up is 50$ and i cant even use it nor return it.

Never tried a pod, liked the sleekness, and Stiiizy rep was super nice. So instead of spending a comparable amount on a 510, bought a pod. I havenât tried any other pod types. But this thing hits beautifully. Absolutely perfect. Airflow, amount of vapor draw, flavor, effect, etc. Absolute primo. So I quickly bought the Biiig.

The only thing I wish was different is that the pod (1g) would sit deeper in the battery and not protrude out so far. I would like even better if it actually covered the pod completely so that no light could get to the oil. Its bigger then the original battery so it's harder to conceal. It also has a nice sturdy heavy duty design. So in conclusion, other than my personal opinions, everything else about it is perfect and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",4.0
