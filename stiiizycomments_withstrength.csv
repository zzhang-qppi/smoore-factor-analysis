0,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月13日,It wasnâ€™t like the one in the picture but Iâ€™m still satisfied tho
1,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月21日,This is fine it's their website that sucks.
2,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月27日,Very good battery but the product I used was trainwreak with that battery 10/10..
3,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月30日,Badass battery. Go Biiig or go home!
4,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月29日,Fix your website. It said to drop by between 9 and 10 and you were closed. Total BS.
5,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月22日,this battery hits hard if you are looking for a good dab pen
6,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月13日,Nice big clouds. Long lasting battery. Just what you need my high tolerance friends
7,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月11日,Easy use
8,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月3日,Love it
9,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月16日,"Battery lasts about 3 days and so easy to take it on the go, also very small for pockets"
10,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月25日,Love the big stiiizy! It charges quickly and has a long battery life. The pods click in easily and fit very secure. My brother pulled one out to show someone and my 8 year old walked in and asked what it was. I was able to quickly convince her that it was like a Roku or Fire stick type thing with 0 questions lol so it works out great if youâ€™re needing to be discreet.
11,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月15日,Works wonders! Gives me pretty good hits compared to a 510 or regular Stiiizy batteries. Would Highly recommend!
12,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月7日,good battery last long
13,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月12日,A+
14,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,Battery size is very compact and discreet. Love the size and shape.
15,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年3月28日,Itâ€™s sleek and a little more discreet. Packs a good punch. Iâ€™ve tried many 510 thread batteries but they would always break or voltage wasnâ€™t strong e0ugh. So I finally gave in to getting A pod type battery. Definitely happy with my purchase.
16,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月3日,First time buying the Stiiizy brand. Great experience!
17,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月29日,"IMO..They Are Cheap And Taste Nasty I mean leave a bad taste in your throat., Also I Din0 About The Slick Ass Batteris I Cant Seem To Hold On To Them.PSssssT..Batttey does 0t stay Charged Very Long Either.."
18,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月22日,Would definitely buy again ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
19,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月31日,It is a very piney gassy pod! I like that even tho itâ€™s a indica strain it doesnâ€™t make you sleepy to the extent of being stuck. You can definitely shop and hit this pod
20,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,I loved dosi. Best flavor.
21,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月9日,"Do-si-dos has been my favorite stizzy carts for a long time. It's best after work before dinner - I relax, I get hungry, and I sleep well."
22,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月31日,"I remember this feeling like a traditional hybrid and didn't 0tice the indica too much.

The experience will vary, person to person but for those that prefer indica... this may 0t be the best option. This is probably good for social stuff."
23,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Second time Iâ€™ve bought the dosidos and does 0t workâ€¦
24,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,I enjoy this strain very much
25,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月2日,Listed as Indica but package said hybrid. Assume it is an Indica dominant plant. Best for relaxing and sleeping.
26,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月28日,"It made me feel energetic, hungry and hard to sit still at times. I donâ€™t mind it when Iâ€™m having a productive day, but when youâ€™re playing video games, this fades really quick."
27,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月25日,itâ€™s one of my faves!
28,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"This pod is a distillate oil, this is meant for road trips and getting out of your 0rmal head space! The vanilla flavor along with some nutty 0tes too makes this a dope ass high experience! Rip it and head over to grab a coffee or take a scooter ride through the neighborhood, pick this pod up with that GIRL SCOUT GREEN battery and head out on adventure with this STIIZY! ðŸª"
29,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,"Read a good book after a few hits, would recommend"
30,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月2日,Sweet flavor
31,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月24日,Great
32,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月15日,Dosidos is the best :)
33,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月18日,Like 90% thc one of the highest
34,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月9日,Great service
35,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月1日,this is my favorite flavor and it keeps me going with both energy and relaxation during the day
36,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月2日,Checked the QR code and it said it was the second one with the same code and itâ€™s 0t suppose to be like that each one has a unique code thatâ€™s y is 1:1
37,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月18日,Quality product for a fair price. You get what you need at a fraction of the price of their competition. Would def recommend.!
38,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,"Didnt  give a head change at all.
The flavor of it was terrible when I hit it taste like plastic"
39,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月5日,Faaaaaadedd

44,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月10日,"0t only do I love Stiiizy products, Connected is the BOMB with customer service"
45,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月3日,Awesome product
46,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月27日,Stizzy pods are the best the 1gr carts seem to last longer than other 1gr carts
47,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月29日,Great for relaxing and getting pain relief
48,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月16日,"i feel high 20 seconds after hitting this one. this is my favorite stiiizy pod. try 0t to over eat before or after or you might feel very nauseous. that happens every to me often, since i use my pen around dinner time often."
49,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月16日,Does the job
50,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月15日,Great all around!
51,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,Good high
52,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月10日,I didnâ€™t care for the taste too much and the high is okay.
53,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月19日,Good indica
54,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月2日,"gets the job done, i feel like they burn out quicker for some reason?"
55,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月11日,Munchies Hardcore gives you that laid back high with an after effect of the total munchies!
56,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月6日,Loved it
57,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月3日,This cartridge is amazing i only need 1 hit to be good for the night and i have the best sleep of my life i wake up feeling relaxed and ready to start the day! The high isnt too intense just e0ugh for you to enjoy yourself and as well as being so concealable its amazing for an on the go high.
58,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月29日,High was nice while it lasted I ended up burning through it in 2 days.
59,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,Vaping calms me down from pain and Iâ€™ve found this product to work real well.
60,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月26日,I love stiiizy theyâ€™re the best I love stiiizyâ€™s blue dream cuz taste like berry! â¤ï¸
61,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月26日,I'm 0t angry anymore.
62,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月21日,I like the way it was easy to smoke and taste was vey pleasant.
63,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月10日,One of my favorites!
64,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月5日,Tasted Fruity and Yummy
65,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月1日,I liked it wish it was stronger
66,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月17日,smooth cart 0t too harsh and good taste
67,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月31日,I didn't get much from this vape..
68,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月27日,Blueberry ðŸ”¥ðŸ«£
69,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月24日,Good sativa. Really wakes you up and gets you going. Smooth and easy. Didnâ€™t really taste like anything but it wasnâ€™t a bad taste either.
70,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月15日,Blue Dream is always a good time
71,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月4日,"This blue dream is the best to relax and think! However, any full gram Stiizy is 0t worth it. So much of the solution comes out as tar and sticks to your teeth, making them look black. This also causes more than half the product to be wasted, so, again, 0t worth buying a full gram. Stick with the half grams if they have it."
72,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月7日,Feeling a little anxious? A puff or two during the day eased my mind and got it refocused on what was important. It did 0t make me feel sleepy or high.
73,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月4日,This product is great for an after0on of video games!!
74,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月20日,"The name speaks for itself. Taste like blueberry slightly, but the cerebral and physical effects are DREAMY.  One of the greatest strains k0wn to mankind."
75,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,"All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
76,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月2日,0pe. Did the same thing. So im out a bunch of moneyâ€¦
77,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"Definitely a solid choice, though I think there is some blueberry flavor added that could be toned down. I'd prefer Stiiizy rosin pods but Artist Tree Fres0 doesn't carry even a single one. Weird. So this is the one of the next best choices."
78,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,Love the taste
79,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月7日,"It did meet my expectations, I do recommend this product!"
80,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月31日,Love this for relaxing or going to sleep.
81,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月25日,"I sucked 90 percent of the wax through the mouth piece. I ate alot of wax and was hot. It was a good high but 0t worth hitting it and sucking out a good portion of wax every time,  and being clogged."
82,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月10日,Ok
83,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月5日,One of ym favorite
84,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月30日,Good but 0t worth the price for the small amount
85,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月30日,Very tasty reminds me the flower.
86,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月10日,It was awesome
87,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月25日,"i love blue dream, tastes amazing!"
88,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月6日,5stars
89,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月15日,"This is my favorite Stiiizy Pod flavor because the Blueberry flavor really goes well with the Blue Dream extract. I've only found a handful of other OG Pods that have good flavoring, but this is by far the most consistent every time. If you're a fan of flavored nic vapes but want to switch to thc, I highly recommend this as a flavored vaping alternative."
90,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月17日,Great for every day life ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
91,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月22日,def my fav hits hard even if you got a tolerance
92,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月22日,Good stuff!
93,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月20日,Love all the Stiizy This was 0 disappointment either
94,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月21日,It was great
95,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月17日,It kind of gave me a headache and the high wasnt as good as the other sativas.
96,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月15日,My absolute favðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»
97,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月7日,"Great tasting berry flavor. Awake, talkative relaxing buzz. Good one to take when you are out and about socializing or want to have a lazy after0on/evening playing games or watching a movie. A toss up between Blue Dream or Do-si-dos during the day for me, either one will be a good choice!"
98,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月1日,Always love the blue dream. Very good for creativity!! :)
99,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月25日,I love stiizy their products never disappoint
100,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月5日,Using this for depression and anxiety during the day. Very smooth and love the battery pack .. just puff 0 pushing buttons easy breezy
101,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月20日,Kind of made me jittery
102,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月13日,Perfect!
103,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月4日,"0w as Iâ€™m older I feel more energetic, it keeps me on track with stuff I need to get done for the day. Overall itâ€™s a good experience if youâ€™re wanting to be alert. If youâ€™re wanting to chill; best pick something else."
104,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月29日,"Blue dream is a great strain...
But, STIIZY blue dream is amazing!!"
105,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月17日,"Such a good strain. The immediate relief from anxiety and panic, nausea, insomnia and headaches is a god send! The flavor is fruity and great too! Overall fire!"
106,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月11日,Blue dream is one of my all time favorite strains
107,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月3日,"Love this stuff. Spend 10 minutes on my porch with this and a mt dew and I'm feeling great for the rest of the night. 10/10 tastes good too, 0t too grassy."
108,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月1日,Blue dream is the go to whether Iâ€™m tryna get a skate sesh in or just chill and kick it at the pad
109,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月28日,"Blue dream is my all time favorite. Only strain I  smoke. Very enjoyable, happy, energetic, outgoing. Brings you out of your shell. A lot more active also great for the late night activities. I highly recommend"
110,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月13日,Extreme experience. Great taste and easy to use. Worked 12 hours pain free around the house and yard! Felt good to get off the couch for a change! Looking forward to the next experience!!!!
111,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月27日,"I like stizzy pods and this one is 0 exception to the many I have tried. The flavor is very minimal compared to the others, but overall high is good."
112,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月24日,"Very clean taste, high was great."
113,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月15日,Best Stiiizy  sativa cart to be honest
114,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月20日,"Really great flavor, and euphoric feeling"
115,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月16日,00t overwhelming with hunger but eases nausea
116,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月7日,Gets you blasted
117,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月28日,Nice high that takes the edge off the pain from my recent hip surgery.
118,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月22日,"I don't vape anymore, but the product was good."
119,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月12日,the flavor is pretty good
120,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月3日,Overall great product
121,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月1日,"It's a classic strain and performs as advertised. However, I did 0t like the taste  or the after taste."
122,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月27日,Highly recommended sativa!  Super great flavor. Stiiizy is my favorite daily driver vape.
123,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月22日,A little to much Blueberry Flavor. Otherwise does the trick. Makes me cough!
124,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月10日,Was very happy with it. Very close to the actual flower
125,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月29日,Great flavor
126,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月18日,"0t bad, and it does have a rather â€œblueâ€ flavor to it. Very clean high. Iâ€™d buy it again"
127,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月6日,The contacts to the battery on this podare bad so. The dosing is really inconsistent
128,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月11日,"Great taste, smooth high, and overall good experience. Would buy again!"
129,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年9月1日,Tasty treat as always! Definitely felt the chill buzz while also feeling stimulated. I was able to still get things done without a grumpy attitude.
130,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月25日,This has a great sativa effect.   Solid boost but without the para0ia. Solid choice for socializing.
131,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月4日,.....excellent.
132,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月21日,"Stiizy is probably the best of best of the disposable Vape Pens - Blue Dream, as a flower product, had always been one of my favorites:  zesty taste (esp. in vaporizing flower); immediate calming & produces energy (I usually walk 2-3 miles daily) - with the Stiizy it is even more enhanced; and a little goes a long ways!"
133,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月12日,"Blue Dream is great but sadly, the driver was out and it was replaced with the as great strawberry cough."
134,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月23日,The best product I've purchased
135,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月17日,Blue Dream has long been a go-to strain for me; Stiiizy makes it so easy to enjoy!
136,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月16日,"I've been using blue dream for years.  I would say it is my go to for sure.  Just watching TV is interesting for me but I LOVE the feeling when we are ""getting busy"" in the bedroom, back yard, etc."
137,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月30日,5th  one love the strain
138,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月10日,Good herb. Really enjoyed.
139,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月8日,Blue dream is the shit.
140,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月27日,1
141,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月21日,I love stiiizy products and trees by far has the best prices best quality and customer service best all-aroundðŸ˜Š but as far as the Disney cartridge Blue Dream goes I'm very satisfied with this cartridge
142,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年1月28日,"Works great, smooth pull and relaxing."
143,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年1月4日,0t bad!! But too weak!!
144,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月10日,Highly recommend great taste wonderful high!!!!
145,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月1日,Is aite

147,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月21日,This is one of my go to for r n r
148,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月4日,1 it did meet my expectations very good product recommend it for relaxing
149,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月31日,"The King Louis is my go-to for helping me fall asleep. I have a tendency to 0t stay asleep,  so this really helps me get more sleep."
150,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月27日,High asf ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘€
151,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月20日,It was good Holmes
152,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月13日,"I enjoyed it , 2 hits get me ripped and it taste good 10/10"
153,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月5日,"mellow, tastes like soap... Won't purchase again"
154,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月17日,"Great for being distillate. Doesn't burn, great taste, I tried this and the Do Si Dos along with Platinum Jack and I believe this one has live resin terps in it as I don't get an irritation when exhaling. Lasts a lot longer than typical 510 carts as well and a better hit/air flow. The battery could be better, it dies pretty fast, but they were free, so what do you expect? lol. 9/10 stars, would buy again. Great for sleep as well."
155,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月11日,This is by far a GREAT product - both quality and taste were on point and will be buying again. Im thrilled to find a hard hitting indica that DOESNT give me the munchies =) I was enticed to try this out since I got the battery for free since you cant use the typical round one.
156,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月8日,Iâ€™m 0t sure why exactly but Stiiizy seems to give me anxiety instead of high and they donâ€™t seem to last very long
157,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月25日,Indica dominant strain with heavy hitting effects similar to that of cookies or a good OG very nice tasting and food over all effects .
158,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,Perfect!
159,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月24日,Super dank
160,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月12日,"I only fw stiiizy, I never 0t get high when I smoke stiiizy lol"
161,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月3日,Great quality.
162,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,great taste and stoney
163,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月10日,"I use King Louie to relax and sleep at night. 
I recommend this if you have a hard time getting settled in the evening."
164,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月9日,Amazing flavor that will put you to bed
165,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月18日,"All the above positive feelings. 
beyond my expectations! 
I’ll be buying this again."
166,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月25日,"Hey hey hey how are you all today, I hope all my cannabis con0isseur‘s out there are having a great day and staying medicated!!! I just wanted to stop by today and share my experience with a king Louis xIII stizzy pods! And tbh they are my favorite pod yet!! It’s got a great taste super euphoric and most of all very very very relaxing!!  I definitely recommend this product for people who have suffering from high stress unmanageable anxiety and if you are having trouble sleeping"
167,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月15日,Best indica
168,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月12日,So happy I found a strain that doesn’t give me munchies!
169,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月2日,"King Louis is a classic pod that will always hit! A solid body and head high that’s relaxing, it does make me pretty tired the next day but that’s to be expected"
170,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月1日,Favorite stiiizy strain most consistent high and flavor is 0t too strong
171,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月25日,Enriched my hiking experience�
172,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月12日,Very flavorful and body relaxing for muscles
173,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月11日,Best high and taste.
174,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月17日,"Depending on the mood, this strain can either make you forget about the long day at work or help you get the mind juices flowing.  But even with the mind going everywhere can be asleep in mid thought in moments"
175,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月30日,"The king is here! By far one of my favorite strains, STIZZY does good by this strain by hitting you hard and quick leaving you open for either deep thoughts or mindless jokes and riffs to do with your favorite group of people. I don't get harsh munchies but I definitely feel this one for a lot longer than other strains. King Louis is a fantastic choice for a sesh with the squad or just watching your favorite videos at home."
176,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年10月3日,Amazing strain to rest the mind and body
177,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月3日,My favorite indica vape. A proper high with great flavor.
178,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,Best flavor!
179,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月1日,I love indicas and this is my favorite pod for late nights in my room while readin(c definitely gives you a relaxing body high. 10/10
180,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年7月2日,"I love the strong mango flavor, it gets me high every time."
181,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月7日,Love the service.
182,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,This is hands down the best tasting indica from stizzy. It’s a straight mango taste very sweet and a little sour I thought it was a sativa for a second given that’s how they all taste. If you want flavor this is it
183,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,It does its job
184,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月27日,"I lived in LA when they dropped this product from their original store, it is my favorite and will always be, 0 one can compete with this company."
185,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年4月12日,King Louis exceeded my expectations. I like the flavor and the high. Really helped me chill.
186,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月27日,Best tasting pod and the high was great too
187,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月18日,Didn’t like how it’s to fruity
188,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年2月6日,Very tasty and potent
189,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月9日,Good value
190,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月27日,I really enjoy the relaxing mood I get from this stiiizy pod and how it helps me relax will definitely buy more and I do and the taste is great.
191,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月19日,"0t the Stiiizy for me. Was mostly only good for sleep relief. I found very little 'high' to it, It just made me tired. The mango flavor was nice, but the cart itself was 0t completely full, a large bubble on the right side. That and the limited high, I had to mark this one down a bit."
192,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月12日,My favorite Stiiizy strain �
193,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月2日,Gives a crazy head high. Loved it
194,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月10日,One of my all time favorite flavors!
195,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月31日,"First time using Stiizy pods,  I must say I really did like this one, flavor was decent but i dont get them for the flavor just an added bonus.  That being said I enjoyed Gelato, but the high didnt seem to last very long but I guess that could be me and building up a resistance to it sadly... Overall, I liked this product, Didnt have any leaks, and so far so good.    You will get a tingle body high or well I did, pain free I must say which is always nice and what I use this for, so will..."
196,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年1月15日,"Decided to try this brand, initially the pods were great, but after a few uses the PODS leak into your mouth and get jammed up. I purchases  2 at once, 1st one that leaked I exchanged. The new one I received and the previous one I had...ALL LEAKED and left me chocking a wad of oil."
197,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月27日,I only go for potency the higher the THC lvl is what I care about & what I'm after. I do 0t give a F about terps. Gelato is usually one of the highest testing carts & I like the strain.
198,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年8月25日,Great high
199,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月16日,Taste was ok and high was ok. Rather go with CDT's for the high
,source,date,comment
200,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年5月14日,Great product  Great price
201,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月8日,Honestly this pod looks used. I’ve never had an issue with any pod I’ve ordered but this one is clear with dark brown air bubbles almost as if someone had already taken some hits.
202,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月14日,Yummy
203,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年9月24日,"Amazing taste, a good mix for a hybrid. All the feels without the munchies."
204,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年8月13日,I would definitely recommend this flavor .
205,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月5日,Good flavor and high
206,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月22日,These Pods are amazing. TEAM stiiizy#1
207,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月12日,"Good high, natural taste. One of my favorite pods"
208,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年3月28日,Pretty chill
209,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月11日,"0t the best tasting but did it’s job, fell right asleep"
210,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月8日,great strain
211,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月5日,This pod leaked immediately and I barely got any use from it before it emptied itself. Very disappointed.
212,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月3日,Gelato pax pod is very fire .
213,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月11日,"Kind of disappointed with this strain, had higher expectations for a lasting high! I felt relaxed but never high stimulated! Almost like vaping a cbd distillate"
214,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月21日,"Local Stiiizy lover Jodie back with a0ther top tier flavor!!! Gelato has always been a frozen treat and 0thing shows this better than the treat you experience from smoking a Gelato Stiiizy. After about 5 rips into that bad boy I could feel calm and a small euphoria which is always amazing. Overall a sweet tasting strain with a punch, stay safe and blaze on �"
215,stiiizy-iheartjane,2019年11月27日,The only thing that I didnt care for was the taste of the gelato. But over than that it's one of my favorite strains.
216,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月10日,The best tasting flavor so far that I have tried.
217,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年8月6日,Honestly didn’t feel much from this.
218,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月30日,Amazing taste & wonderful high
219,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年7月14日,"While it's smooth, it tastes like I'm vaping grape Kool-Aid powder. As an all-day smoker, the taste quickly became overbearing and unpleasant. This product feels like it was developed for twelve-year-olds, 0t adults. 

It's a nice a relaxing buzz, but too much leaves me feeling agitated. There are better strains out there for me. Blue Burst is ideal for anyone who habitually s0rted Pixi Stix as a child."
220,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月23日,yummy flavor never disappoints
221,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年6月8日,Blue burst from stiizy tastes great. It tastes like grape pixie sticks. The feeling is smooth and very relaxing. As a hybrid you expect a little sativa and indica but this one is mainly indica feeling without the feeling of sleepiness. Definitely recommend this flavor over other flavors.
222,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月12日,Good product!
223,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年3月12日,"If you like cheap gas station vapes that taste like a stale sugar free gummy bear, then you will love this. I spent $112 just to throw this directly in the trash. I don't even think there is any THC in this because there is 0t even the slightest bit of essence of marijuana. I knew as soon as I opened it and smelled the nasty fruit smell that I was 0t going to like this, I tried to do an even exchange for a pure strain in the same brand and was told 0 so I tried one hit and couldn't even..."
224,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月24日,The bud was good I used it to relax
225,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月14日,Worked really well for numbing my back pain and helping me just chill out.
226,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月13日,Taste profile ebbs and flows. Some are alright...others taste like drinking a bottle of bubbles from the dollar store.
227,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年2月4日,"All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
228,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年12月10日,Ok
229,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年11月22日,The product lasted for a while. Literally tasted like a blue jolly rancher. Recommend for helping you finish those last minute papers.
230,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月18日,Pleasant with an indica slant to it.
231,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月12日,"1, very much so"
232,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年9月2日,awesome flavor
233,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年7月23日,Blue Burst is my favorite of all the Stiiizy flavors!
234,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月7日,Favorite flavor so far.  Great high and taste good.
235,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月16日,it has a very fruity taste and has a nice high
236,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年4月8日,Wish the pod itself worked better!  Many defective
237,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月16日,"Taste like a blue starburst, great high too"
238,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月24日,"My blue burst pod was a dud, this isn’t a bad thing but made me realize, if your pod doesn’t work, keep your receipt and head back same day, D2 employees will gladly help you out (same day) 
The flavor is super strong and taste like a refreshing spoonful of blueberries, it’s a distillate oil pod with a great taste and a high that hits right in the head, the taste and strong high of course, makes this worth buying in a gram pod, pick this up with a blue battery and rep that BLUEBERRY STIIIZY! ��"
239,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年1月28日,The high is good but I don't like the taste
240,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月29日,"It was new packaging and I feel like it went quicker than the other ones. But other than that, it still tastes good."
241,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月26日,"I don’t k0w if Stiiizy changed something up recently but 1. This doesn’t taste as good as blue burst has for me in the past just by a little and 
2. The oil seems thicker, longer lasting. I’m happy!"
242,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年12月5日,"Great taste, almost like a grape/blue raspberry flavor. Would buy again."
243,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月5日,Great taste and good pod to use while getting tasks done around the house or needing an extra boost for creativity !!
244,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年11月3日,good (-:

250,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年6月10日,"Overall good, tasty. First time trying a Stiiizy product. Battery and set up is  easy and discreet. Sometimes it seems to get plugged up."
251,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,Loved it! It's my go to.
252,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年5月26日,My favorite

256,stiiizy-iheartjane,2021年1月4日,One of my favorite flavors! very smooth refreshing taste
257,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月27日,"Description of product says “blue Gummy” bu when I got the package it said “blue raspberry” ? Idk it might be just me, but the taste reminds Me of the Old school “Flinstones” Vitamins you would find in your grandmas medicine cabinet ."
258,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月12日,my favorite flavor so far
259,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月10日,Great taste and terps but doesn’t get you too high. Idk just my experience.
260,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月7日,"0t much of anything, almost as if it was on the low-low end of some form of dosage."
261,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年11月7日,0t as strong of a high I was looking for but it did ease my mind and made me really chill. The flavor is pretty good too.
262,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年10月9日,"Very nice, even high as described. Would purchase again!"
263,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月5日,Product was amazing. Tastes so good
264,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年8月5日,Great tasting product with even better results. Perfect one for me to do the job and keep me active.
265,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月27日,This was my 1st try with this hybrid. It's nice. It actually was quite helpful with some digestion issues I had. K0cked the nausea out fast. I appreciated that greatly. The flavor has a slightly odd aftertaste. I'd call the true flavor 'burnt raspberry'.
266,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年7月25日,TASTED FIRE
267,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年6月23日,Tastes nice :)
268,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月27日,tastes like skittles or blueberry gummy
269,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月17日,"this flavor is very tasty in my opinion, one of the best tasting stiiizy ive tried so far, goes well with an energy drink"
270,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年4月3日,BERRY GOOD STUFF...ENJOY
271,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年9月8日,"Great Strain , Definitely will enjoy lots"

273,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年5月1日,This cartridge got me in a place that I could enjoy.
274,stiiizy-iheartjane,2023年4月14日,Taste is too strong and smoke is harsh. Stays charged longer than lime though
275,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年10月28日,Product was great in making me relaxed. Only complaint about this vape pen is that it gets clogged from time to time. I would buy more but it’s a real bummer when you try to activate the vape pen and it’s clogged.
276,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月19日,"This was a great disposal pen 0 charging ever need good consistently till the end!
My new favorite!! Will buy again."
277,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月16日,Didn’t k0w if I would repurchase a stiiizy so I started with a disposable starter pen. It worked out for me because I ended up decided to buy a battery and pods for the stiiizy.
278,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年6月9日,"An amazing strain. Smooth and delicious! Definitely works wonders if you microdose throughout the day. Convenient and easy to use, would definitely recommend 10/10 every time I’ve used it!"
279,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月26日,Great flavor. Super clean distilled vape. Stiiizy does a great job distilling and keeping high thc levels. Highly recommend trying any Stiiizy product.
280,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年3月2日,Got a great buzz from this one
281,stiiizy-iheartjane,2022年2月10日,It was all good but it stopped working for me mid way through
282,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年12月5日,Taste is an 8 high is a 6ish l was high but wanted to be higher.....but it last pretty long only use it during emergencies. This pen makes me want to explore other vapes
283,stiiizy-iheartjane,2020年5月6日,I love Blue Dream and the stiizy pen hits.

661,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月19日,I am very happy with the products.
662,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月27日,Hey
663,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月6日,Hard to pull feels like Iâm going to collapse a damn lung cool idea tho.
664,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月5日,"Bought 2, 1 worked, one did not. Required bank intervention to get refund due to poor customer service. I want to like Stiiizy products but this makes it difficult to trust the brand."
665,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月11日,"This battery is horrible. cheap, low quality metal and it only stays charged for a few hours. no wonder they gave it to me for free at their patient appreciation."
666,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月21日,"I have purchased 3 defective pens from stiiizy, successfully exchanged 1. After the headache of the first exchange I just said F**** it and ate the next. As a medical patient, this really sucks. It took over a month to deal with customer service, and ended with my bank stepping in because of stiiizys bad business. unbelievable. I couldn't make this crap up."
667,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月20日,I have had so many of my friends tell me that this is the best one on the market..... I can assure you it isn't. The packaging looks cheap and the weed is just ok.
668,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月6日,"Bought a replacement battery since my last one stopped working. This battery stopped working just like the one before. The micro usb does not charge, no light shows when itâs plugged in. Iâve had it just about two weeks."
669,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月23日,"Honestly as a parent at times you need something to help you decompress. As the kids became older it became harder to explain why mommy and daddy had to take walks outside in turns to ""get some air"". These have become out life savers. Get some nice relaxation in, all without smelling. We still take our walks to get air BUT these hit so hard that it only takes a few minutes outside and no mess! Love you Stiz"
670,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月28日,"But seriously, besides being absolutely adorable, this pen is perfect! Iâm super clumsy and am constantly dropping my vape pens. Several times Iâve broken a full cartridge, but with this design, itâs really difficult to drop it at an angle that would break. Itâs also lightweight and discreet, itâs small/ slim enough to fit in even small pockets or a wallet. Another problem Iâve encountered with other pens is having to replace the batteries more times than I can count because the plate get pushed into the battery over time from over tightening when charging or connecting cartridges, but again, this design allows you to just drop the cartridge in, and it charges like a phone, solving both issues. I love it!"
671,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月6日,"I love how it looks with my freshly done manicure, I love how it looks when its just sitting on my counter, I love how it looks ALWAYS!! Im glad i treated myself with this.. she's gorgeous and discreet. Blows gorgeous Kush Clouds too btw.. I tried strawberry cough and fell in love! Cannot wait to try them all!!"
672,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月22日,"Dopest, sleekest, battery by the brand. Stiiizy's really supporting Breast cancer awareness with this one."
673,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月6日,"Stiizy is a really good product and helps me with even my worst pain, its my First and only pen. Hope they have plans in the future for a âACDCâ or âHarlequinâ High CBD Low THC Cart!"
674,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月23日,"couldnât wait to come back to LA & get my first STIIZY. & of course I wanted the rose gold, so sleek & lady like. I have no plans to go back to other pens that iâve used in the past. only thing i would possible want is a case? something small & compact that I can put it in to protect it while itâs in my bag. other than that, i am sold! customer for life ðð½"
675,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年5月9日,"Had an og Black one, bought this pink! Itâs cute, love it because the hubby has his black so we alway know whoâs is whoâs. Lol! Clean hits and charges fast! Definitely my fave!"
676,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年7月23日,"So, as for a general review of the battery, it's really good! It has a nice, discreet form factor, superb build quality, a battery that lasts for a good while and the pods fit perfectly into their slot and look very sleek. It works great with all Stiiizy pods, even the live resins. Now, as for the color, it's a very nice pastel pink with a smooth, matte metal surface. It's a really nice, calming color that's also a bit easier to find when you're looking your battery to take another hit."
677,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月20日,Blaze delivers stizzy pods and batteries ð !!! 40$ for thÃ© set and delivered sounds dope and theyâre fast ð¨
678,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年7月24日,"Itâs something for the summertime ! Super Smooth, but packs a punch. This may be a bias review because I love Rose anything and Stiiizy never disappoints. Great flavor, Great rip."
679,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月26日,"aesthetically pleasing, produces huge clouds, discreet, and I love that the pods dont leak/clog. Pods are potent and the whole system makes for an amazing on the go vape."

690,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年12月14日,Explendid customer service
691,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月26日,"Perfect size to put in my pocket, and really cute :)"
692,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月29日,I'm sure this won't break by the way it feels on hand.
693,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月31日,"Attracted to this coz it looks elegant, solidly built too!"
694,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年11月8日,nice and discreet!!! love the color and the feel
695,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年6月15日,I was having a bit of a hard time trying to decide which color to get. I thought I had picked the rose gold at the counter but I'm not trippin cos I really like this color and I'm happy even if it was a mistake cos this one is perfect...the purple seemed s bit too bright and the rose gold not girly/pink enough for what I was looking for. Perfect shade of pink because it's pretty discrete and is overall just a very classy color. Super lightweight so I can see how people tend to loose their pens really easily especially if you're hi af ð Glad I ended up picking up s stiiizy system cos (so far) I'm very happy with it since I also got it on Saturday when the batteries and pods are 20% off so it was $60 for the battery and 2 .5 gram pods ð
696,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年4月17日,"I quite like the stiiizy system. The carts taste better than a lot of 510 carts ive tried, although there are tons of brands that make 510 carts vs only 1 for stiiizy. The pros of this are that every stiiizy cart you buy will be pretty good because they all are made by the same company and that company happens to be pretty good. Another pro is that the carts arent too pricey, but this varies depending on where you are and what dispensary you are shopping at. The last pro ive noticed is that the stiiizy carts seem to last a long time, idk if its because a lot of 510 thread carts are under filled or something, but i got a half gram stiiizy cart to start out and i have been hitting it non stop and it has easily lasted a longer time than all 510 half gram carts ive ever had. And it looks like its still half full. The cons of this product are that there is only one brand that makes carts, so if the quality starts to drop then you cant just switch brands and keep using this battery."
697,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月7日,nice color
698,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年9月27日,Beautiful you need to get this color!
699,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月17日,"Slim, perfect, and love how its discreet."

713,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月11日,This thing is awesome. Are used to have a PAx and I hated it. This thing kicks PAX ass. Cartridges are half the price. the oil is amazing.
714,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月7日,I was so determined to get this color and I'm so happy I waited!! It really looks better in person. I got pineapple express for my first pod and I wasn't expecting to hit so good. Definitely recommend!
715,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月6日,I love the stiiizy rose color battery! A little more expensive than other cartridges but worth it. Itâs so discrete and I love the color.
716,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月2日,It matched with my phone and itâs super cute.
717,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月25日,"I love my rose gold Stiiizzy. I also agree, Strawberry Cough is an amazing sativa. My highs last pretty long and that makes me happy. I get things done and I feel creative."

719,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月7日,"the best pen got a few colors rose, blue and black. they all work good"
720,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月25日,I had tried their products while I was out in Cali & loved it. They definitely need to bring their product over to D.C & Maryland Dispensaries!!
721,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年9月17日,I want to order??
722,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月17日,Dope finish! I'm rocking the Rose w/black lanyard. Vice versa. The ROSE finish is platinum!ðððð¤£ð
723,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月7日,"Treated myself with this little guy, itâs so small, sleek and lightweight! The color is so elegant and modern, hits beautifully and I definitely recommend."
724,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月7日,I love my pink battery. It almost looks silver in the sun and is very light and cute!
725,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月6日,"The pen is gorgeous in person and feels pretty to hold, but is a bit slippery."
726,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年7月30日,ððð¥my girl loves it
727,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月22日,"I have been using batteries for years and this was my First Stiizy purchase. I am SO DISAPPOINTED with this particular battery, the magnets used to hold the Hella expensive pods are WEAK!! The first day I had it I stored it in my bra, this is where I put all of my batteries when I don't have pockets. Anyways, ran several errands and when I pulled the battery out to hit it. There was NO pod attached, It had fallen off and I didn't even notice!!!!! $50 gone!! Come on Stiizy, this is a joke. The quality of the oil is hands down Bomb asf BUT for their price you need to do Better with the batteries!!!! I have another brand of battery and the magnetic is so Strong that I've NEVER lost a cart or even have it come detached from the battery even after dropping several times. I'm now a little uneasy about buying more pods for fear of them falling off. I don't have money to be throwing away. PLEASE Stiizy, do better and change the Structure and Quality of the batteries."
728,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年11月12日,The battery will charge red and show it being dead but after the 45-60 minute time period it will still be dead and wonât even turn on white when hitting with pod
729,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月8日,"Itâs a nice battery I like how it charges with an android charger so if it dies on me I can get ahold of a charger pretty easy, easier than it would be if it was the standard 510 thread charger . I love how itâs available in different colors . Just wish more cartridges were compatible with this battery .. but all in 5 out of 5ð¤"
730,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月1日,Just picked it up today for $20 way out in the middle of nowhere. Just happened to be in the right place at the right time!!! Plus orange is my favorite color ð§¡ð§¡ð§¡
731,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年8月14日,"Quick charge, reliable hit, and good design; Iâve recommended it to multiple people who also love it."
732,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年1月16日,I've got four batteries and this one is easily the best. So easy to charge with the chord provided; it takes around an hour to fully charge again. They are also pretty sturdy and can take moderate abuse.
733,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年12月31日,AFTER LOOSING 5 BLACK BATTERIES I DECIDED TO GO WITH A MORE VIBRANT COLOR AND THIS ONE WENT BEYOND EXPECTATION ð¯ð¯ðð

754,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年10月26日,Greatttttyt
755,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月30日,"This pen is cutting edge and the best for me so far. Sleek and powerful this battery lasts me a week on two short charges. The charging port is an android charger which is very convenient. The cart is magnetic which I also like. I still have my âcanâ pen since I havenât been able to find another brands making carts for stizzy pens. My tender hooked me up with a nice Stizzy bag and lanyard. The lanyard came with a stizzy pen rubber holder so I donât lose my pen, which apparently happens since theyâre so slim and small. Maybe a find my pen app? Need help contact me."
756,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年6月16日,low key they hi key pens just wish battery lasted longer
757,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年12月10日,"Great design. It feels awesome in my hand. But, invest in this only when you are ready to leave all others behind. 510 threads are everywhere, making them very easy to switch and try new varieties. The pod is better preforming, but limited to certain brands. So, are you a Stiizy person? I am not a brand person, because each oil brand has given me both positive and negative experiences, so I like to shop around. With this battery, I can only buy their products. That would be cool if their product was premium, but even the bud tender suggested a different brand. I just had to try it for myself.... itâs not premium, it just tastes great. Now I have a battery that I might never use again, unless I decide to give your oil another chance."
758,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月7日,Did the job
759,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年11月4日,got one on the first of the month what I like about it is that it's small and easy to hit my biggest complaint about the pin is that I have to charge it every other day and on top of that the cartridge I got witch was hard core og don't taste good at all to further note that all of my other pins that I have I can smoke a full gram before I have to charge them what's up with that
760,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年11月20日,the battery is going to cartridge last about 5 times then it will
761,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月20日,The camo finish feels as if itâs slip resistant. A lot less likely to slip out of my hand than my red one. ðð»
762,stiiizy-weedmaps,2023年3月1日,I love this battery just wished I had the bigger one haha
763,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年5月5日,Camo finish looks amazing and feels great in the hands. Long lasting battery. 100%
764,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年10月15日,"Lost my device, Got this, love how it looks and i can vouch for its durability"
765,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月31日,"The camo colorway fits my style!, besides that this works as advertised. No issues"
766,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月23日,This starter kit is amazing! Love the design!
767,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,I got this cause the camo design rockkksss! Build quality is... well premium. Feels solid on hand
768,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月15日,"Best looking of the bunch. I mean that's not just my opinion, i usually get compliments on how nice this looks"
769,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年3月7日,Love the cameo style of the pen! Will probably get one for my brother!
770,stiiizy-weedmaps,2022年2月15日,You gotta say this got style
771,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月30日,"Fire design, I don't think you can dislike this"
772,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年11月11日,"Looks great, feels premium! Works well."
773,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月30日,"I like the whole camo thing, certainly eye catching. Device works as expected."
774,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年10月30日,The Traskmaster approves of how this device looks!
775,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月30日,Now this here device deserves more love!
776,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年9月15日,Something about the Camo design speaks to me
777,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月25日,"Works perfectly, love the looks on this one. Solid device"
778,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年8月15日,"Works well, battery lasts long and that camo looks great!"
779,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月27日,"I prefer bigger Stiiizy batteries, but if you want something more portable and lowkey, this does a pretty good job. Love the design!"
780,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年3月10日,"I love this design! Build quality is great as well, but it's the Camo that convinced me to grab this!"
781,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年2月20日,"the taste is a bit ugly, but good stiiizy"
782,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年1月8日,Makes an awesome product from the battery to the cartridges I see a lot of people on here say the cars go fast 510 Last me two days a pod last me almost 3 sometimes four
783,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年3月29日,"love mine i shouldâve purchased sooner, hits well and carts are affordable. bad thing is that it seems like it does go through carts quite a bit faster than a regular 510 battery does. shouldve got the orange or any bright color instead tho bc it blends in with everything so i lose this one all the timeð"
784,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月17日,"Poor rating for the batteries yall. Just take care of your batteries. Keep your rubber tops for the bottom of your batteries as well as for the top and bottom of your carts ya digg!? Lord knows how much crap can end up in pockets. Don't OVERCHARGE! It doesn't take long sheesh. Been rockin 2 black batteries since. Now I'm rockin the Rose w/ the black lanyard. My next one is going to be a Red battery for my Sats! Fasho! The finish on these batteries are so amazingly done. I might just get a blue one for those evening Indies. Cant hurt to have back ups. They normally last me a couple days before I have to recharge. Brids are on the Rose and on the rise. Ha ha! .... Sorry I had to do it... It's about color coding too people. On the carts I use red, green, and purple sharpies to fill in the lines but for the most part my tastebuds know my favorite kines. You know what would be dope tho is if the lines where color coded red, green, or purple. JGEAH! You know my STIIIZ!"
785,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年4月29日,I bought a blue one a week ago and have had that time to use it every day. Iâve been researching different strains and flavors and just ordered more cartridges and a second [red] Stiiizy battery as a backup/spare. I love the gentle hits I can take and I feel like I can better control my dosing. Happy
786,stiiizy-weedmaps,2018年8月5日,"This pen is so slick and portable I take this thing everywhere. I still live by other cartridge, wax, etc. pens, but this makes the vaping so effortless. The pods can switch instantly, they attach to the pen magnetically. The pen itself is only on when you breathe thru it, no buttons. The pods seem to last quite a while, don't need to breathe in long to get a decent hit. 10/10 my dude"
787,stiiizy-weedmaps,2019年2月14日,Love the color and how quickly it charges.
788,stiiizy-weedmaps,2021年4月14日,I have silver and red. They do charge fast and seem to last a good long time. I use them with live resin pods and they work very well.
789,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年2月23日,This is my first stiiizy battery and my opinion on this is that the color is sexy asf!!!ð I love how itâs simple asf and itâs pocket sized and you can take it anywhere. I truly recommend this for starters who like red.ðâ¤ï¸
790,stiiizy-weedmaps,2020年1月14日,I donât really like pods because it limits youâre selection but I did however like the convenience of it . Would recommend!
